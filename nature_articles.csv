oncology,EZH2 inhibitors promote β-like cell regeneration in young and adult type 1 diabetes donors,2024-01-01,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01707-x,"β-cells are a type of endocrine cell found in pancreatic islets that synthesize, store and release insulin. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), T-cells of the immune system selectively destroy the insulin-producing β-cells. Destruction of these cells leads to a lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin administration for survival. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapies that stimulate β-cell growth and induce β-cell function. We and others have shown that pancreatic ductal progenitor cells are a promising source for regenerating β-cells for T1D owing to their inherent differentiation capacity. Default transcriptional suppression is refractory to exocrine reaction and tightly controls the regenerative potential by the EZH2 methyltransferase. In the present study, we show that transient stimulation of exocrine cells, derived from juvenile and adult T1D donors to the FDA-approved EZH2 inhibitors GSK126 and Tazemetostat (Taz) influence a phenotypic shift towards a β-like cell identity. The transition from repressed to permissive chromatin states are dependent on bivalent H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 chromatin modification. Targeting EZH2 is fundamental to β-cell regenerative potential. Reprogrammed pancreatic ductal cells exhibit insulin production and secretion in response to a physiological glucose challenge ex vivo. These pre-clinical studies underscore the potential of small molecule inhibitors as novel modulators of ductal progenitor differentiation and a promising new approach for the restoration of β-like cell function."
oncology,A dataset of digital holograms of normal and thalassemic cells,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02818-4,"Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is an intriguing medical diagnostic tool due to its label-free and quantitative nature, providing high-contrast images of phase samples. By capturing both intensity and phase information, DHM enables the numerical reconstruction of quantitative phase images. However, the lateral resolution is limited by the diffraction limit, which prompted the recent suggestion of microsphere-assisted DHM to enhance the DHM resolution straightforwardly. The use of such a technique as a medical diagnostic tool requires testing and validation of the proposed assays to prove their feasibility and viability. This paper publishes 760 and 609 microsphere-assisted DHM images of normal and thalassemic red blood cells obtained from a normal and thalassemic male individual, respectively."
oncology,Acanthopanax senticosus ameliorates steatohepatitis through HNF4 alpha pathway activation in mice,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50625-z,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a common liver disease worldwide, and is associated with dysregulation of lipid metabolism, leading to inflammation and fibrosis. Acanthopanax senticosus Harms (ASH) is widely used in traditional medicine as an adaptogen food. We examined the effect of ASH on steatohepatitis using a high-fat diet mouse model. Mice were fed a choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet with ASH extract (ASHE). After 6 weeks, liver RNA transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Our findings revealed that mice fed a high-fat diet with 5% ASHE exhibited significantly reduced liver steatosis. These mice also demonstrated alleviated inflammation and reduced fibrosis in the liver. IPA of RNA-Seq indicated that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 alpha), a transcription factor, was the activated upstream regulator (P-value 0.00155, z score = 2.413) in the liver of ASHE-fed mice. Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter 8 and carboxylesterase 2, downstream targets of HNF4 alpha pathway, were upregulated. Finally, ASHE-treated HepG2 cells exposed to palmitate exhibited significantly decreased lipid droplet contents. Our study provides that ASHE can activate HNF4 alpha pathway and promote fat secretion from hepatocytes, thereby serving as a prophylactic treatment for steatohepatitis in mice."
oncology,Alterations in mitochondria isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumors of patients with epithelial ovarian cancers,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-51009-z,"Metabolic alterations play an essential role in ovarian carcinogenesis. The flexibility of mitochondrial functions facilitates cellular adaptation to the tough environment associated with carcinogenesis. An understanding of the differences in mitochondrial functions in normal ovaries and cancers could provide a basis for further exploration of future mitochondria-based screening, diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and targeted therapy for epithelial ovarian cancers. The main objective of this study was to assess mitochondrial function profiles measured from PBMCs and ovarian tissues of epithelial ovarian cancers in comparison with normal ovaries. A total of 36 patients were recruited for the study, all of whom underwent primary surgical treatment for malignant epithelial ovarian neoplasm. Of these, 20 patients were in the early stage and 16 patients were in the advanced stage. Additionally, 21 patients who had pelvic surgery for benign gynecologic conditions, with normal ovaries incidentally removed, were recruited as controls. At the time of surgery, a blood sample was collected from each participant for PBMC isolation, and ovarian tissue was retained for molecular studies. These studies included the examination of oxidative stress, mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) changes, and mitochondrial swelling. Clinical and histopathological data were also collected and compared between different stages of epithelial ovarian cancers: early-stage (group 1), advanced-stage (group 2), and normal ovaries (group 3). The levels of cellular oxidative stress, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of participants with ovarian cancer were significantly lower than those of the control group. However, the mitochondrial respiratory parameters measured from the PBMCs were similar across all three groups. Furthermore, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and mitochondrial swelling were observed in ovarian tissues of both early-stage and advanced-stage cancer groups. We demonstrated the dynamic nature of mitochondrial ROS production, biogenesis, and respiratory function in response to epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis. The flexibility of mitochondrial functions under diverse conditions may make it a challenging therapeutic target for ovarian cancer."
oncology,Assessment of lower limb muscle strength can predict fall risk in patients with chronic liver disease,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50574-7,"Falls are caused by a combination of factors, including loss of lower limb muscle strength (LMS), and associated with declined performance status (PS). Age-related sarcopenia is generally associated with decreased muscle mass and strength of lower limb muscle but without a noticeable loss of those of upper limb or trunk muscle. However, no reports have focused on falls or LMS in chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. This study is the first to analyze the risk factors for falls in patients with CLD, focusing on LMS measurement using the Locomoscan. This study enrolled 315 CLD patients whose LMS was measured. The patients who experienced falls more than 1 year ago or during the observation period were classified as those who experienced falls. We found that risk factors for falls were PS1/2 and decreased LMS (< 0.32 N/kg). The group with sarcopenia had a higher frequency of decreased LMS (54 vs. 26%, p = 0.001) and falls (24 vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001) compared to the non-sarcopenia group. This study found that decreased LMS was an independent risk factor for falls. Assessment of LMS may be used as a better marker associated with the risk of falls in patients with CLD."
oncology,Avapritinib-based SAR studies unveil a binding pocket in KIT and PDGFRA,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44376-8,"Avapritinib is the only potent and selective inhibitor approved for the treatment of D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the most common primary mutation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA). The approval was based on the NAVIGATOR trial, which revealed overall response rates of more than 90%. Despite this transformational activity, patients eventually progress, mostly due to acquired resistance mutations or following discontinuation due to neuro-cognitive side effects. These patients have no therapeutic alternative and face a dismal prognosis. Notable, little is known about this drug’s binding mode and its medicinal chemistry development, which is instrumental for the development of the next generation of drugs. Against this background, we solve the crystal structures of avapritinib in complex with wild-type and mutant PDGFRA and stem cell factor receptor (KIT), which provide evidence and understanding of inhibitor binding and lead to the identification of a sub-pocket (Gα-pocket). We utilize this information to design, synthesize and characterize avapritinib derivatives for the determination of key pharmacophoric features to overcome drug resistance and limit potential blood-brain barrier penetration."
oncology,Bipolar androgen therapy plus nivolumab for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: the COMBAT phase II trial,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44514-2,"Cyclic high-dose testosterone administration, known as bipolar androgen therapy (BAT), is a treatment strategy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we report the results of a multicenter, single arm Phase 2 study (NCT03554317) enrolling 45 patients with heavily pretreated mCRPC who received BAT (testosterone cypionate, 400 mg intramuscularly every 28 days) with the addition of nivolumab (480 mg intravenously every 28 days) following three cycles of BAT monotherapy. The primary endpoint of a confirmed PSA50 response rate was met and estimated at 40% (N = 18/45, 95% CI: 25.7–55.7%, P = 0.02 one-sided against the 25% null hypothesis). Sixteen of the PSA50 responses were achieved before the addition of nivolumab. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), median PSA progression-free survival, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), and safety/tolerability. The ORR was 24% (N = 10/42). Three of the objective responses occurred following the addition of nivolumab. After a median follow-up of 17.9 months, the median rPFS was 5.6 (95% CI: 5.4–6.8) months, and median OS was 24.4 (95% CI: 17.6–31.1) months. BAT/nivolumab was well tolerated, resulting in only five (11%) drug related, grade-3 adverse events. In a predefined exploratory analysis, clinical response rates correlated with increased baseline levels of intratumoral PD-1 + T cells. In paired metastatic tumor biopsies, BAT induced pro-inflammatory gene expression changes that were restricted to patients achieving a clinical response. These data suggest that BAT may augment antitumor immune responses that are further potentiated by immune checkpoint blockade."
oncology,Cell cycle arrest induces lipid droplet formation and confers ferroptosis resistance,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44412-7,"How cells coordinate cell cycling with cell survival and death remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that cell cycle arrest has a potent suppressive effect on ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death induced by overwhelming lipid peroxidation at cellular membranes. Mechanistically, cell cycle arrest induces diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)–dependent lipid droplet formation to sequester excessive polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that accumulate in arrested cells in triacylglycerols (TAGs), resulting in ferroptosis suppression. Consequently, DGAT inhibition orchestrates a reshuffling of PUFAs from TAGs to phospholipids and re-sensitizes arrested cells to ferroptosis. We show that some slow-cycling antimitotic drug–resistant cancer cells, such as 5-fluorouracil–resistant cells, have accumulation of lipid droplets and that combined treatment with ferroptosis inducers and DGAT inhibitors effectively suppresses the growth of 5-fluorouracil–resistant tumors by inducing ferroptosis. Together, these results reveal a role for cell cycle arrest in driving ferroptosis resistance and suggest a ferroptosis-inducing therapeutic strategy to target slow-cycling therapy-resistant cancers."
oncology,Disulfidptosis-related prognostic signature correlates with immunotherapy response in colorectal cancer,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49954-w,"Disulfidptosis (DSP), a form of cell death caused by disulphide stress, plays an important role in tumour progression. However, the mechanisms by which DSP regulates the tumour microenvironment remain unclear. Thus, we analysed the transcriptome profiles and clinical data, which were obtained from the TCGA database, of 540 patients with colorectal cancer. Compared with the patients with low DSP expression, those with high DSP expression exhibited significantly better survival outcomes; lower stromal and ESTIMATE scores; significantly higher numbers of CD4+ T cells, M2 macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils; higher expression of immune checkpoint-related genes; and lower Tregs and HLA-DQB2 levels. A prognostic signature established based on DSP-related genes demonstrated an increase in risk score with a higher clinical stage. Risk scores negatively correlated with dendritic cells, eosinophils, and CD4+ T cells and significantly positively correlated with Treg cells. Patients with higher risk scores experienced significantly worse survival outcomes and immunotherapy non-response. Our nomogram model, combining clinicopathological features and risk scores, exhibited robust prognostic and predictive power. In conclusion, DSP-related genes actively participated in regulating the tumour microenvironment. Thus, they can serve as biomarkers to provide targeted treatment for colorectal cancer."
oncology,ER+/PR− phenotype exhibits more aggressive biological features and worse outcome compared with ER+/PR+ phenotype in HER2-negative inflammatory breast cancer,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50755-4,"The loss of progesterone receptor (PR) often predicts worse biological behavior and prognosis in estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) breast cancer. However, the impact of PR status on inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) has not been studied. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate the influence of PR on IBC. Patients with ER+ and HER2-negative IBC were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Pearson’s χ2 test was used to compare the clinicopathological characteristics between patients with estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR +) and patients with estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative (ER+/PR−). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the effects of PR status on the breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) in IBC. Overall, 1553 patients including 1157 (74.5%) patients with ER+/PR+ and 396 (25.5%) patients with ER+/PR− were analyzed in our study. The patients with ER+/PR− were more likely to be high histological grade (p < 0.001) and liver metastasis (p = 0.045) compared to patients with ER+/PR+. Despite higher chance of receiving chemotherapy (83.6% vs 77.3%, P = 0.008), patients with ER+/PR− showed worse BCSS (5-year BCSS rate, 34.3% vs 51.3%, P < 0.001) and OS (5-year OS rate, 31.3% vs 46.1%, P < 0.001) compared with ER+/PR+ phenotype. Multivariate survival analysis showed that patients with ER+/PR− still had worse BCSS (hazard ratios [HR]: 1.764, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.476–2.109, P < 0.001) and OS (HR: 1.675, 95% CI 1.411–1.975, P < 0.001) than ER+/PR+ phenotype. Furthermore, patients with ER+/PR− showed worse outcomes than ER+/PR+ phenotype in most subgroups, especially in patients with younger age (≤ 60 years), lower histological grade, lymph node involved and distant metastasis. Patients with ER+/PR− had more aggressive biological behaviors and worse outcomes than patients with ER+/PR+ in IBC. Stronger treatments maybe needed for IBC patients with ER+/PR−."
oncology,"Epidemiology of 7375 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 in Germany, reported via a prospective, nationwide surveillance study in 2020–2022",2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49210-1,"By means of a nationwide, prospective, multicenter, observational cohort registry collecting data on 7375 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admitted to children's hospitals in Germany, March 2020–November 2022, our study assessed the clinical features of children and adolescents hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2, evaluated which of these patients might be at highest risk for severe COVID-19, and identified underlying risk factors. Outcomes tracked included: symptomatic infection, case fatality, sequelae at discharge and severe disease. Among reported cases, median age was one year, with 42% being infants. Half were admitted for reasons other than SARS-CoV-2. In 27%, preexisting comorbidities were present, most frequently obesity, neurological/neuromuscular disorders, premature birth, and respiratory, cardiovascular or gastrointestinal diseases. 3.0% of cases were admitted to ICU, but ICU admission rates varied as different SARS-CoV-2 variants gained prevalence. Main risk factors linked to ICU admission due to COVID-19 were: patient age (> 12 and 1–4 years old), obesity, neurological/neuromuscular diseases, Trisomy 21 or other genetic syndromes, and coinfections at time of hospitalization. With Omicron, the group at highest risk shifted to 1–4-year-olds. For both health care providers and the general public, understanding risk factors for severe disease is critical to informing decisions about risk-reduction measures, including vaccination and masking guidelines."
oncology,Evaluation of the reliability and readability of ChatGPT-4 responses regarding hypothyroidism during pregnancy,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50884-w,"Hypothyroidism is characterized by thyroid hormone deficiency and has adverse effects on both pregnancy and fetal health. Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a large language model trained with a very large database from many sources. Our study was aimed to evaluate the reliability and readability of ChatGPT-4 answers about hypothyroidism in pregnancy. A total of 19 questions were created in line with the recommendations in the latest guideline of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) on hypothyroidism in pregnancy and were asked to ChatGPT-4. The reliability and quality of the responses were scored by two independent researchers using the global quality scale (GQS) and modified DISCERN tools. The readability of ChatGPT was assessed used Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) Score, Flesch-Kincaid grade level (FKGL), Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) tools. No misleading information was found in any of the answers. The mean mDISCERN score of the responses was 30.26 ± 3.14; the median GQS score was 4 (2–4). In terms of reliability, most of the answers showed moderate (78.9%) followed by good (21.1%) reliability. In the readability analysis, the median FRE was 32.20 (13.00–37.10). The years of education required to read the answers were mostly found at the university level [9 (47.3%)]. Although ChatGPT-4 has significant potential, it can be used as an auxiliary information source for counseling by creating a bridge between patients and clinicians about hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Efforts should be made to improve the reliability and readability of ChatGPT."
oncology,Exploring shared therapeutic targets in diabetic cardiomyopathy and diabetic foot ulcers through bioinformatics analysis,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50954-z,"Advanced diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients are often accompanied by severe peripheral artery disease. For patients with DCM combined with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), there are currently no good therapeutic targets and drugs. Here, we investigated the underlying network of molecular actions associated with the occurrence of these two complications. The datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We performed enrichment and protein–protein interaction analyses, and screened for hub genes. Construct transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs regulatory networks for validated hub genes. Finally, drug prediction and molecular docking verification were performed. We identified 299 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs), many of which were involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism. 6 DEGs were identified as hub genes (PPARG, JUN, SLC2A1, CD4, SCARB1 and SERPINE1). These 6 hub genes were associated with inflammation and immune response. We identified 31 common TFs and 2 key miRNAs closely related to hub genes. Interestingly, our study suggested that fenofibrate, a lipid-lowering medication, holds promise as a potential treatment for DCM combined with DFU due to its stable binding to the identified hub genes. Here, we revealed a network involves a common target for DCM and DFU. Understanding these networks and hub genes is pivotal for advancing our comprehension of the multifaceted complications of diabetes and facilitating the development of future therapeutic interventions."
oncology,FOXP3+ regulatory T cell perturbation mediated by the IFNγ-STAT1-IFITM3 feedback loop is essential for anti-tumor immunity,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44391-9,"Targeting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs) is an efficient way to evoke an anti-tumor immune response. However, how Tregs maintain their fragility and stability remains largely unknown. IFITM3 and STAT1 are interferon-induced genes that play a positive role in the progression of tumors. Here, we showed that IFITM3-deficient Tregs blunted tumor growth by strengthening the tumor-killing response and displayed the Th1-like Treg phenotype with higher secretion of IFNγ. Mechanistically, depletion of IFITM3 enhances the translation and phosphorylation of STAT1. On the contrary, the decreased IFITM3 expression in STAT1-deficient Tregs indicates that STAT1 conversely regulates the expression of IFITM3 to form a feedback loop. Blocking the inflammatory cytokine IFNγ or directly depleting STAT1-IFITM3 axis phenocopies the restored suppressive function of tumor-infiltrating Tregs in the tumor model. Overall, our study demonstrates that the perturbation of tumor-infiltrating Tregs through the IFNγ-IFITM3-STAT1 feedback loop is essential for anti-tumor immunity and constitutes a targetable vulnerability of cancer immunotherapy."
oncology,Gut microbial metabolite facilitates colorectal cancer development via ferroptosis inhibition,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01314-6,"The gut microbiota play a pivotal role in human health. Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbes participate in the progression of tumorigenesis through the generation of carcinogenic metabolites. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. In the present study we show that a tryptophan metabolite derived from Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, trans-3-indoleacrylic acid (IDA), facilitates colorectal carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, IDA acts as an endogenous ligand of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to transcriptionally upregulate the expression of ALDH1A3 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3), which utilizes retinal as a substrate to generate NADH, essential for ferroptosis-suppressor protein 1(FSP1)-mediated synthesis of reduced coenzyme Q10. Loss of AHR or ALDH1A3 largely abrogates IDA-promoted tumour development both in vitro and in vivo. It is interesting that P. anaerobius is significantly enriched in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). IDA treatment or implantation of P. anaerobius promotes CRC progression in both xenograft model and ApcMin/+ mice. Together, our findings demonstrate that targeting the IDA–AHR–ALDH1A3 axis should be promising for ferroptosis-related CRC treatment."
oncology,Gut microbiota facilitate chronic spontaneous urticaria,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44373-x,"Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) comes with gut dysbiosis, but its relevance remains elusive. Here we use metagenomics sequencing and short-chain fatty acids metabolomics and assess the effects of human CSU fecal microbial transplantation, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Roseburia hominis, and metabolites in vivo. CSU gut microbiota displays low diversity and short-chain fatty acids production, but high gut Klebsiella pneumoniae levels, negatively correlates with blood short-chain fatty acids levels and links to high disease activity. Blood lipopolysaccharide levels are elevated, link to rapid disease relapse, and high gut levels of conditional pathogenic bacteria. CSU microbiome transfer and Klebsiella pneumoniae transplantation facilitate IgE-mediated mast cell(MC)-driven skin inflammatory responses and increase intestinal permeability and blood lipopolysaccharide accumulation in recipient mice. Transplantation of Roseburia hominis and caproate administration protect recipient mice from MC-driven skin inflammation. Here, we show gut microbiome alterations, in CSU, may reduce short-chain fatty acids and increase lipopolysaccharide levels, respectively, and facilitate MC-driven skin inflammation."
oncology,HSV1 microRNAs in glioblastoma development: an in silico study,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45249-2,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor. Recent findings highlighted the significance of viral microRNAs (miRs) in regulating post-transcriptional mRNA expression in various human conditions. Although HSV1 encodes viral miRs and affects the central nervous system, no study investigated the roles of HSV1-encoding miRs in GBM development. This study applied in silico approaches to investigate whether HSV1-encoding miRs are involved in GBM development and, if so, how they regulate tumor-suppressive/oncogenes expression in GBM. This study leveraged bioinformatics approaches to identify the potential effect of HSV1 miRs in GBM development. The GSE158284, GSE153679, and GSE182109 datasets were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes in GBM tissues and cell lines using the limma package in the R software. The GSE182109 dataset was analyzed to determine gene expression at the single-cell levels using the Seurat package in the R software. The TCGA-GTEX, GDSC, CTRP, immunogenetic, and enrichment analyses were performed to study the impact of identified viral HSV1 miRs targets in GBM development. hsv1-miR-H6-3p is upregulated in GBM and can be responsible for EPB41L1 and SH3PXD2A downregulation in GBM tissues. Also, hsv1-miR-H1-5p is upregulated in GBM and can decrease the expression of MELK, FZD2, NOVA1, TMEM97, PTPRZ1, and PDGFC in GBM development. The single-cell RNA sequencing analyses have demonstrated that MELK, FZD2, NOVA1, TMEM97, PTPRZ1, and PDGFC are expressed in astrocytes residing in the GBM microenvironment. This study provides novel insights into the potential roles of HSV1 miRs in GBM pathogenesis and offers a reference for further studies on the significance of HSV1 miRs in GBM development."
oncology,High throughput intracellular delivery by viscoelastic mechanoporation,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44447-w,"Brief pulses of electric field (electroporation) and/or tensile stress (mechanoporation) have been used to reversibly permeabilize the plasma membrane of mammalian cells and deliver materials to the cytosol. However, electroporation can be harmful to cells, while efficient mechanoporation strategies have not been scalable due to the use of narrow constrictions or needles which are susceptible to clogging. Here we report a high throughput approach to mechanoporation in which the plasma membrane is stretched and reversibly permeabilized by viscoelastic fluid forces within a microfluidic chip without surface contact. Biomolecules are delivered directly to the cytosol within seconds at a throughput exceeding 250 million cells per minute. Viscoelastic mechanoporation is compatible with a variety of biomolecules including proteins, RNA, and CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, as well as a range of cell types including HEK293T cells and primary T cells. Altogether, viscoelastic mechanoporation appears feasible for contact-free permeabilization and delivery of biomolecules to mammalian cells ex vivo."
oncology,IL-10-expressing CAR T cells resist dysfunction and mediate durable clearance of solid tumors and metastases,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02060-8,"The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in treating several hematopoietic malignancies has been difficult to replicate in solid tumors, in part because of T cell exhaustion and eventually dysfunction. To counter T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment, we metabolically armored CAR T cells by engineering them to secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10). We show that IL-10 CAR T cells preserve intact mitochondrial structure and function in the tumor microenvironment and increase oxidative phosphorylation in a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier-dependent manner. IL-10 secretion promoted proliferation and effector function of CAR T cells, leading to complete regression of established solid tumors and metastatic cancers across several cancer types in syngeneic and xenograft mouse models, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer. IL-10 CAR T cells also induced stem cell-like memory responses in lymphoid organs that imparted durable protection against tumor rechallenge. Our results establish a generalizable approach to counter CAR T cell dysfunction through metabolic armoring, leading to solid tumor eradication and long-lasting immune protection."

This study aimed to identify biomarkers. 22 ESS cases were analyzed using Illumina microarrays. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via Limma. DEGs were analyzed with String and Cytoscape. Core genes were enriched with GO and KEGG, their pan-cancer implications and immune aspects were studied. 413 DEGs were found by exome sequencing, 2174 by GSE85383 microarray. 36 common genes were identified by Venn analysis, and 10 core genes including RBFOX1, PCDH7, FAT1 were selected. Core gene GO enrichment included cell adhesion, T cell proliferation, and KEGG focused on related pathways. Expression was evaluated across 34 cancers, identifying immune DEGs IGF1 and AVPR1A. Identifying the DEGs not only helps improve our understanding of LG-ESS, HG-ESS but also promises to be potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis between LG-ESS and HG-ESS and new therapeutic targets."

We identified 292 eligible patients treated with SRT between 2005 and 2018 at 15 institutions. Clinical relapse-free survival (cRFS) between the ≥ 66 Gy (n = 226) and < 66 Gy groups (n = 66) were compared using the Log-rank test, followed by univariate and multivariate analyses and a subgroup analysis. After a median follow-up of 73 months, 6-year biochemical relapse-free survival, cRFS, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 58, 92, 98, and 94%, respectively. Six-year cRFS rates in the ≥ 66 Gy and < 66 Gy groups were 94 and 87%, respectively (p = 0.022). The multivariate analysis revealed that Gleason score ≥ 8, seminal vesicle involvement, PSA at BCR after RP ≥ 0.5 ng/ml, and a dose < 66 Gy correlated with clinical relapse (p = 0.015, 0.012, 0.024, and 0.0018, respectively). The subgroup analysis showed the consistent benefit of a dose ≥ 66 Gy in patients across most subgroups. Doses ≥ 66 Gy were found to  significantly, albeit borderline, increase the risk of late grade ≥ 2 GU toxicity compared to doses < 66 Gy (14% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.055).

This paper presents fabricated implantable drug-loaded microporous poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS) devices for the delivery of targeted therapeutic agents [Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone conjugated paclitaxel (PTX-LHRH) and Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone conjugated prodigiosin (PG-LHRH)] for the treatment and possible prevention of triple-negative cancer recurrence. In vitro assessment using the Alamar blue assay demonstrated a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in percentage of cell growth in a time-dependent manner in the groups treated with PG, PG-LHRH, PTX, and PTX-LHRH. Subcutaneous triple-negative xenograft breast tumors were then induced in athymic female nude mice that were four weeks old. Two weeks later, the tumors were surgically but partially removed, and the device implanted. Mice were observed for tumor regrowth and organ toxicity. The animal study revealed that there was no tumor regrowth, six weeks post-treatment, when the LHRH targeted drugs (LHRH-PTX and LHRH-PGS) were used for the treatment. The possible cytotoxic effects of the released drugs on the liver, kidney, and lung are assessed using quantitative biochemical assay from blood samples of the treatment groups. Ex vivo histopathological results from organ tissues showed that the targeted cancer drugs released from the implantable drug-loaded device did not induce any adverse effect on the liver, kidneys, or lungs, based on the results of qualitative toxicity studies. The implications of the results are discussed for the targeted and localized treatment of triple negative breast cancer."
oncology,Inhibition of DNMT3B expression in activated hepatic stellate cells overcomes chemoresistance in the tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50680-6,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex disease associated with a plethora of environmental and genetic/hereditary causative risk factors, more so than other oncological indications. Additionally, patients with HCC exhibit fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver-related disease. This complicated etiology can affect the disease course and likely contributes to its poor prognosis. In this study, we aimed to improve HCC therapy by evaluating combination treatment using anti-cancer and anti-fibrosis drugs via identification of novel anti-fibrosis drugs. We performed high-throughput screening of 10,000 compounds to identify hepatic fibrosis inhibitors through morphometry analysis of multicellular hepatic spheroid (MCHS) models and identified CHIR-99021 as a candidate anti-fibrotic drug. Treatment with CHIR-99021 induced loss of cell–cell interactions and suppression of extracellular matrix-related protein expression via reprogramming of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation in MCHSs. In particular, CHIR-99021 regulated DNMT3B expression only in activated HSCs. Moreover, CHIR-99021 markedly improved the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC- multicellular tumor spheroids in vitro and through induction of apoptosis by decreasing DNMT3B expression in vivo. In summary, these findings suggest that targeting HSC reprogramming by attenuation of DNMT3B expression in the tumor environment might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis and HCC."
oncology,Integrated multi-omics analyses identify anti-viral host factors and pathways controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44175-1,"Host anti-viral factors are essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection but remain largely unknown due to the biases of previous large-scale studies toward pro-viral host factors. To fill in this knowledge gap, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR dropout screen and integrate analyses of the multi-omics data of the CRISPR screen, genome-wide association studies, single-cell RNA-Seq, and host-virus proteins or protein/RNA interactome. This study uncovers many host factors that are currently underappreciated, including the components of V-ATPases, ESCRT, and N-glycosylation pathways that modulate viral entry and/or replication. The cohesin complex is also identified as an anti-viral pathway, suggesting an important role of three-dimensional chromatin organization in mediating host-viral interaction. Furthermore, we discover another anti-viral regulator KLF5, a transcriptional factor involved in sphingolipid metabolism, which is up-regulated, and harbors genetic variations linked to COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. Anti-viral effects of three identified candidates (DAZAP2/VTA1/KLF5) are confirmed individually. Molecular characterization of DAZAP2/VTA1/KLF5-knockout cells highlights the involvement of genes related to the coagulation system in determining the severity of COVID-19. Together, our results provide further resources for understanding the host anti-viral network during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may help develop new countermeasure strategies."
oncology,Integrative genotyping of cancer and immune phenotypes by long-read sequencing,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44137-7,"Single-cell transcriptomics has become the definitive method for classifying cell types and states, and can be augmented with genotype information to improve cell lineage identification. Due to constraints of short-read sequencing, current methods to detect natural genetic barcodes often require cumbersome primer panels and early commitment to targets. Here we devise a flexible long-read sequencing workflow and analysis pipeline, termed nanoranger, that starts from intermediate single-cell cDNA libraries to detect cell lineage-defining features, including single-nucleotide variants, fusion genes, isoforms, sequences of chimeric antigen and TCRs. Through systematic analysis of these classes of natural ‘barcodes’, we define the optimal targets for nanoranger, namely those loci close to the 5’ end of highly expressed genes with transcript lengths shorter than 4 kB. As proof-of-concept, we apply nanoranger to longitudinal tracking of subclones of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and describe the heterogeneous isoform landscape of thousands of marrow-infiltrating immune cells. We propose that enhanced cellular genotyping using nanoranger can improve the tracking of single-cell tumor and immune cell co-evolution."

We presented the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with intraocular schwannoma.MethodsRetrospective case series were collected between May 2005 and July 2021 in Beijing Tongren Hospital.ResultsA total of 28 patients were diagnosed with intraocular schwannoma on histopathological examination of surgical specimen. The median age was 39 years (range: 12–64). Fourteen patients were female and 14 were male. Among the all subjects, 21/28 patients (75.0%) presented as visual loss, and 3/28 patients (10.7%) had visual field loss. Intraocular schwannoma presented as nonpigmented mass in the ciliary body in 12/28 cases (42.9%), in the choroid in 9/28 cases (32.1%), and in ciliochoroid in 7/28 cases (25.0%). Intraocular schwannoma was often clinically misdiagnosed as uveal melanoma, which occurred in 16/28 patients (57.1%). Tumour excision with pars plana vitrectomy was performed for all included patients. Endoresection with lens removal was performed for tumours in the choroid, while transscleral resection was performed for tumours located in ciliary body or ciliochoroid. Increased light transmission was detected in 12/28 cases (42.9%). In the consecutive follow-up (median: 73 months, range: 7–193 months), no cases of recurrence or metastatic disease were detected.ConclusionsIntraocular schwannoma is a rare benign tumour. It usually presents as nonpigmented mass, which can easily be misdiagnosed as nonpigmented uveal melanoma."
oncology,"MAD2L2, a key regulator in ovarian cancer and promoting tumor progression",2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50744-7,"Ovarian cancer (OVCA), a prevalent gynecological malignancy, ranks as the fourth most common cancer among women. Mitotic Arrest Deficient 2 Like 2 (MAD2L2), a chromatin-binding protein and a component of DNA polymerase ζ, has been previously identified as an inhibitor of tumor growth in colorectal cancer. However, the roles of MAD2L2 in OVCA, including its expression, impact, and prognostic significance, remain unclear. We employed bioinformatics tools, Cox Regression analysis, and in vitro cell experiments to investigate its biological functions. Our findings reveal that MAD2L2 typically undergoes genomic alterations, such as amplifications and deep deletions. Moreover, we observed an overexpression of MAD2L2 mRNA in OVCA patients, correlating with reduced survival rates, particularly in those with Grade IV tumors. Furthermore, analysis of mRNA biofunctions indicated that MAD2L2 is predominantly localized in the organellar ribosome, engaging mainly in NADH dehydrogenase activity. This was deduced from the results of gene ontology enrichment analysis, which also identified its role as a structural constituent in mitochondrial translation elongation. These findings were corroborated by KEGG pathway analysis, further revealing MAD2L2’s involvement in tumor metabolism and the cell death process. Notably, MAD2L2 protein expression showed significant associations with various immune cells, including CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and Myeloid dendritic cells. Additionally, elevated levels of MAD2L2 were found to enhance cell proliferation and migration in OVCA cells. The upregulation of MAD2L2 also appears to inhibit the ferroptosis process, coinciding with increased mTOR signaling activity in these cells. Our study identifies MAD2L2 as a novel regulator in ovarian tumor progression and offers new insights for treating OVCA."

However, existing cell annotation methods utilizing high-plex spatial proteomics data are resource intensive and necessitate iterative expert input, thereby constraining their scalability and practicality for extensive datasets. We introduce MAPS (Machine learning for Analysis of Proteomics in Spatial biology), a machine learning approach facilitating rapid and precise cell type identification with human-level accuracy from spatial proteomics data. Validated on multiple in-house and publicly available MIBI and CODEX datasets, MAPS outperforms current annotation techniques in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving pathologist-level precision even for typically challenging cell types, including tumor cells of immune origin. By democratizing rapidly deployable and scalable machine learning annotation, MAPS holds significant potential to expedite advances in tissue biology and disease comprehension."
oncology,Metallopolymer strategy to explore hypoxic active narrow-bandgap photosensitizers for effective cancer photodynamic therapy,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43890-z,"Practical photodynamic therapy calls for high-performance, less O2-dependent, long-wavelength-light-activated photosensitizers to suit the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Iridium-based photosensitizers exhibit excellent photocatalytic performance, but the in vivo applications are hindered by conventional O2-dependent Type-II photochemistry and poor absorption. Here we show a general metallopolymerization strategy for engineering iridium complexes exhibiting Type-I photochemistry and enhancing absorption intensity in the blue to near-infrared region. Reactive oxygen species generation of metallopolymer Ir-P1, where the iridium atom is covalently coupled to the polymer backbone, is over 80 times higher than that of its mother polymer without iridium under 680 nm irradiation. This strategy also works effectively when the iridium atom is directly included (Ir-P2) in the polymer backbones, exhibiting wide generality. The metallopolymer nanoparticles exhibiting efficient O2•− generation are conjugated with integrin αvβ3 binding cRGD to achieve targeted photodynamic therapy."

We leverage two precision oncology programs to investigate rhabdomyosarcoma with FUS/EWSR1-TFCP2 fusions, an orphan malignancy without effective therapies. All tumors exhibit outlier ALK expression, partly accompanied by intragenic deletions and aberrant splicing resulting in ALK variants that are oncogenic and sensitive to ALK inhibitors. Additionally, recurrent CKDN2A/MTAP co-deletions provide a rationale for PRMT5-targeted therapies. Functional studies show that FUS-TFCP2 blocks myogenic differentiation, induces transcription of ALK and truncated TERT, and inhibits DNA repair. Unlike other fusion-driven sarcomas, TFCP2-rearranged tumors exhibit genomic instability and signs of defective homologous recombination. DNA methylation profiling demonstrates a close relationship with undifferentiated sarcomas. In two patients, sarcoma was preceded by benign lesions carrying FUS-TFCP2, indicating stepwise sarcomagenesis. This study illustrates the potential of linking precision oncology with preclinical research to gain insight into the classification, pathogenesis, and therapeutic vulnerabilities of rare cancers."

We provide open access to technical aspects of these assays to enable their implementation in other laboratories, and demonstrate their suitability for proteomic profiling in mice by measuring normal protein abundances in tissues from three mouse strains: C57BL/6NCrl, NOD/SCID, and BALB/cAnNCrl. Sex- and strain-specific differences in protein abundances are identified and described, and the measured values are freely accessible via our MouseQuaPro database: http://mousequapro.proteincentre.com. Together, this large library of quantitative MRM-MS assays established in mice and the measured baseline protein abundances represent an important resource for research involving mouse models."
oncology,Mutant p53 gains oncogenic functions through a chromosomal instability-induced cytosolic DNA response,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44239-2,"Inactivating TP53 mutations leads to a loss of function of p53, but can also often result in oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) of mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins which promotes tumor development and progression. The GOF activities of TP53 mutations are well documented, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we study the mutp53 interactome and find that by targeting minichromosome maintenance complex components (MCMs), GOF mutp53 predisposes cells to replication stress and chromosomal instability (CIN), leading to a tumor cell-autonomous and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent cytosolic DNA response that activates downstream non-canonical nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cell (NC-NF-κB) signaling. Consequently, GOF mutp53-MCMs-CIN-cytosolic DNA-cGAS-STING-NC-NF-κB signaling promotes tumor cell metastasis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through antagonizing interferon signaling and regulating genes associated with pro-tumorigenic inflammation. Our findings have important implications for understanding not only the GOF activities of TP53 mutations but also the genome-guardian role of p53 and its inactivation during tumor development and progression."

In this multicenter, randomized, phase 2 trial (NCT04195828), patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (clinical T2-4N + M0) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive neoadjuvant camrelizumab and apatinib combined with nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 (CA-SAP) or chemotherapy SAP alone (SAP) for 3 cycles. The primary endpoint was the major pathological response (MPR), defined as <10% residual tumor cells in resection specimens. Secondary endpoints included R0 resection rate, radiologic response, safety, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The modified intention-to-treat population was analyzed (CA-SAP [n = 51] versus SAP [n = 53]). The trial has met pre-specified endpoints. CA-SAP was associated with a significantly higher MPR rate (33.3%) than SAP (17.0%, P = 0.044). The CA-SAP group had a significantly higher objective response rate (66.0% versus 43.4%, P = 0.017) and R0 resection rate (94.1% versus 81.1%, P = 0.042) than the SAP group. Nonsurgical grade 3-4 adverse events were observed in 17 patients (33.3%) in the CA-SAP group and 14 (26.4%) in the SAP group. Survival results were not reported due to immature data. Camrelizumab and apatinib combined with chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant regimen was tolerable and associated with favorable responses for LAGC."

In this phase II trial (NCT01613300), we investigated safety and effectiveness of OFA-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). High-risk B-cell NHL patients with chemorrefractory disease or post-autologous SCT relapse were eligible. OFA was added to a standard RIC regimen. Primary endpoint was grade 3-4 aGVHD rate, while secondary endpoints included CR and survival rates. Thirty-three patients were included (median age 51; diffuse large B-cell:68%, HLA-identical donor: 74%). No grade >2 OFA toxicity was observed. Acute GVHD affected 77% of patients (16% grade 3-4). Remarkably, GVHD achieved CR in 75% of patients after first-line treatment. Chronic GVHD, primarily mild or moderate, occurred in 54% of patients. NHL CR rate at day +100 was 81%. Relapses occurred in 7 patients after a median of 3 months. Causes of death were lymphoma progression (5), infections (10), and GVHD (2). At 24 months, progression-free and overall survival rates were 50.1 and 51.6% respectively. OFA-RIC regimen is safe and effective, though acute GVHD remains a significant complication. However, data suggest that OFA could mitigate its severity."
oncology,Overcoming therapeutic resistance in oncolytic herpes virotherapy by targeting IGF2BP3-induced NETosis in malignant glioma,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44576-2,"Oncolytic virotherapy holds promise for cancer treatment, but the factors determining its oncolytic activity remain unclear. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with cancer progression, yet their formation mechanism and role in oncolytic virotherapy remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that, in glioma, upregulation of IGF2BP3 enhances the expression of E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MIB1, promoting FTO degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This results in increased m6A-mediated CSF3 release and NET formation. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) stimulates IGF2BP3-induced NET formation in malignant glioma. In glioma models in female mice, a BET inhibitor enhances the oncolytic activity of oHSV by impeding IGF2BP3-induced NETosis, reinforcing virus replication through BRD4 recruitment with the CDK9/RPB-1 complex to HSV gene promoters. Our findings unveil the regulation of m6A-mediated NET formation, highlight oncolytic virus-induced NETosis as a critical checkpoint hindering oncolytic potential, and propose targeting NETosis as a strategy to overcome resistance in oncolytic virotherapy."

In this randomized, open-label, phase 2 study (NEOSUMMIT-01), patients with resectable gastric or gastro-esophageal junction cancer clinically staged as cT3-4aN + M0 were randomized (1:1) to receive either three preoperative and five postoperative 3-week cycles of SOX/XELOX (chemotherapy group, n = 54) or PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab plus SOX/XELOX, followed by toripalimab monotherapy for up to 6 months (toripalimab plus chemotherapy group, n = 54). The primary endpoint was pathological complete response or near-complete response rate (tumor regression grade (TRG) 0/1). The results showed that patients in the toripalimab plus chemotherapy group achieved a higher proportion of TRG 0/1 than those in the chemotherapy group (44.4% (24 of 54, 95% confidence interval (CI): 30.9%–58.6%) versus 20.4% (11 of 54, 95% CI: 10.6%–33.5%)), and the risk difference of TRG 0/1 between toripalimab plus chemotherapy group and chemotherapy group was 22.7% (95% CI: 5.8%–39.6%; P = 0.009), meeting a prespecified endpoint. In addition, a higher pathological complete response rate (ypT0N0) was observed in the toripalimab plus chemotherapy group (22.2% (12 of 54, 95% CI: 12.0%–35.6%) versus 7.4% (4 of 54, 95% CI: 2.1%–17.9%); P = 0.030), and surgical morbidity (11.8% in the toripalimab plus chemotherapy group versus 13.5% in the chemotherapy group) and mortality (1.9% versus 0%), and treatment-related grade 3–4 adverse events (35.2% versus 29.6%) were comparable between the treatment groups. In conclusion, the addition of toripalimab to chemotherapy significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving TRG 0/1 compared to chemotherapy alone and showed a manageable safety profile.

Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA sequencing to delineate specific cell subsets involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) relapse and response to immunotherapy. We identified POSTN+ extracellular matrix cancer-associated fibroblasts (EM CAFs) as a prominent onco-fetal interacting hub, promoting tumor progression. Cell–cell communication and spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed crosstalk and co-localization of onco-fetal cells, including POSTN+ CAFs, FOLR2+ macrophages and PLVAP+ endothelial cells. Further analyses suggest an association between onco-fetal reprogramming and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor cell proliferation and recruitment of Treg cells, ultimately influencing early relapse and response to immunotherapy. In summary, our study identifies POSTN+ CAFs as part of the HCC onco-fetal niche and highlights its potential influence in EMT, relapse and immunotherapy response, paving the way for the use of onco-fetal signatures for therapeutic stratification."

Encapsulation of celecoxib (CXB) and prodigiosin (PDG) into zein/sodium caseinate nanoparticles (NPs) produce homogenous and spherical nanoparticles with good encapsulation efficiencies (EE %) and bioavailability. In vitro cytotoxicity study conducted on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell lines revealed that there was a significant decline in the IC50 for encapsulated drugs when compared to each drug alone or their free combination. In addition, results demonstrated that there is a synergism between CXB and PDG as their combination indices were 0.62251 and 0.15493, respectively. Moreover, results of scratch wound healing assay revealed enhanced antimigratory effect of free drugs and fabricated NPs in comparison to untreated cells. Furthermore, In vitro results manifested that formulated nanoparticles exhibited induction of apoptosis associated with reduced angiogenesis, proliferation, and inflammation. In conclusion, nanoencapsulation of multiple drugs into nanoparticles might be a promising approach to develop new therapies for the managing of triple negative breast cancer."

A promising approach is leveraging multiplexed tissue analysis techniques such as cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF), which enable visualization and quantification of 10–60 antigens at single-cell resolution from individual tissue sections. In this study, we qualified a breast cancer-specific antibody panel, including HER2, ER, and PR, for multiplexed tissue imaging. We then compared the performance of these antibodies against established clinical standards using pixel-, cell- and tissue-level analyses, utilizing 866 tissue cores (representing 294 patients). To ensure reliability, the CyCIF antibodies were qualified against HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data from the same samples. Our findings demonstrate the successful qualification of a breast cancer antibody panel for CyCIF, showing high concordance with established clinical antibodies. Subsequently, we employed the qualified antibodies, along with antibodies for CD45, CD68, PD-L1, p53, Ki67, pRB, and AR, to characterize 567 HER2+ invasive breast cancer samples from 189 patients. Through single-cell analysis, we identified four distinct cell clusters within HER2+ breast cancer exhibiting heterogeneous HER2 expression. Furthermore, these clusters displayed variations in ER, PR, p53, AR, and PD-L1 expression. To quantify the extent of heterogeneity, we calculated heterogeneity scores based on the diversity among these clusters. Our analysis revealed expression patterns that are relevant to breast cancer biology, with correlations to HER2 ITH and potential relevance to clinical outcomes."

In this study, we investigated the stability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics features in rectal cancer using both anatomical MRI and quantitative MRI (qMRI), when different methods to define the tumor volume were used. Second, we evaluated the prognostic value of stable features associated to 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). On a 1.5 T MRI scanner, 81 patients underwent diagnostic MRI, an extended diffusion-weighted sequence with calculation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and a multiecho dynamic contrast sequence generating both dynamic contrast-enhanced and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR, allowing quantification of Ktrans, blood flow (BF) and area under the DSC curve (AUC). Radiomic features were extracted from T2w images and from ADC, Ktrans, BF and AUC maps. Tumor volumes were defined with three methods; machine learning, deep learning and manual delineations. The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) assessed the stability of features. Internal validation was performed on 1000 bootstrap resamples in terms of discrimination, calibration and decisional benefit. For each combination of image and volume definition, 94 features were extracted. Features from qMRI contained higher prognostic potential than features from anatomical MRI. When stable features (> 90% ICC) were compared with clinical parameters, qMRI features demonstrated the best prognostic potential. A feature extracted from the DSC MRI parameter BF was associated with both PFS (p = 0.004) and OS (p = 0.004). In summary, stable qMRI-based radiomics features was identified, in particular, a feature based on BF from DSC MRI was associated with both PFS and OS."

However, the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in the AAO remain unclear. To investigate the risk factors with the AAO of PD, a total of 3156 patients with PD from the UK Biobank were included in this study. We evaluated the effects of polygenic risk scores (PRS), nongenetic risk factors, and their interaction on the AAO using Mann–Whitney U tests and regression analyses. We further identified the genes interacting with nongenetic risk factors for the AAO using genome-wide environment interaction studies. We newly found physical activity (P < 0.0001) was positively associated with AAO and excessive daytime sleepiness (P < 0.0001) was negatively associated with AAO, and reproduced the positive associations of smoking and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug intake and the negative association of family history with AAO. In the dose-dependent analyses, smoking duration (P = 1.95 × 10−6), coffee consumption (P = 0.0150), and tea consumption (P = 0.0008) were positively associated with AAO. Individuals with higher PRS had younger AAO (P = 3.91 × 10−5). In addition, we observed a significant interaction between the PRS and smoking for AAO (P = 0.0316). Specifically, several genes, including ANGPT1 (P = 7.17 × 10−7) and PLEKHA6 (P = 4.87 × 10−6), may influence the positive relationship between smoking and AAO. Our data suggests that genetic and nongenetic risk factors are associated with the AAO of PD and that there is an interaction between the two."

SECOMBIT (NCT02631447) was a randomized, three-arm, noncomparative phase II trial in which patients were randomized to one of two sequences with immunotherapy or targeted therapy first, with a third arm in which an 8-week induction course of targeted therapy followed by a planned switch to immunotherapy was the first treatment. BRAF/MEK inhibitors were encorafenib plus binimetinib and checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab plus nivolumab. Primary outcome of overall survival was previously reported, demonstrating improved survival with immunotherapy administered until progression and followed by BRAF/MEK inhibition. Here we report 4-year survival outcomes, confirming long-term benefit with first-line immunotherapy. We also describe preliminary results of predefined biomarkers analyses that identify a trend toward improved 4-year overall survival and total progression-free survival in patients with loss-of-function mutations affecting JAK or low baseline levels of serum interferon gamma (IFNy). These long-term survival outcomes confirm immunotherapy as the preferred first-line treatment approach for most patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma, and the biomarker analyses are hypothesis-generating for future investigations of predictors of durable benefit with dual checkpoint blockade and targeted therapy."
oncology,T-cell stimulating vaccines empower CD3 bispecific antibody therapy in solid tumors,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44308-6,"CD3 bispecific antibody (CD3 bsAb) therapy is clinically approved for refractory hematological malignancies, but responses in solid tumors have been limited so far. One of the main hurdles in solid tumors is the lack of sufficient T-cell infiltrate. Here, we show that pre-treatment vaccination, even when composed of tumor-unrelated antigens, induces CXCR3-mediated T-cell influx in immunologically ‘cold’ tumor models in male mice. In the absence of CD3 bsAb, the infiltrate is confined to the tumor invasive margin, whereas subsequent CD3 bsAb administration induces infiltration of activated effector CD8 T cells into the tumor cell nests. This combination therapy installs a broadly inflamed Th1-type tumor microenvironment, resulting in effective tumor eradication. Multiple vaccination formulations, including synthetic long peptides and viruses, empower CD3 bsAb therapy. Our results imply that eliciting tumor infiltration with vaccine-induced tumor-(un)related T cells can greatly improve the efficacy of CD3 bsAbs in solid tumors."
oncology,TMIGD2 is an orchestrator and therapeutic target on human acute myeloid leukemia stem cells,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43843-6,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is initiated and sustained by a hierarchy of leukemia stem cells (LSCs), and elimination of this cell population is required for curative therapies. Here we show that transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain containing 2 (TMIGD2), a recently discovered co-stimulatory immune receptor, is aberrantly expressed by human AML cells, and can be used to identify and enrich functional LSCs. We demonstrate that TMIGD2 is required for the development and maintenance of AML and self-renewal of LSCs but is not essential for normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, TMIGD2 promotes proliferation, blocks myeloid differentiation and increases cell-cycle of AML cells via an ERK1/2-p90RSK-CREB signaling axis. Targeting TMIGD2 signaling with anti-TMIGD2 monoclonal antibodies attenuates LSC self-renewal and reduces leukemia burden in AML patient-derived xenograft models but has negligible effect on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Thus, our studies reveal the function of TMIGD2 in LSCs and provide a promising therapeutic strategy for AML."
oncology,Targeting HDACs for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma therapy,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50956-x,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in tumorigenesis and progression, however, their role in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is not well understood. In this study, we examined the expression levels, mutations, and clinical significance of HDACs in DLBCL. Additionally, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Chidamide, a novel HDAC inhibitor, to provide scientific evidence for targeting HDACs in DLBCL patients. We extracted transcriptome data of DLBCLs––including 47 lymph node samples and 337 whole-blood-cell controls––from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Bioinformatic analyses of HDAC expression, mutation, and correlation with the clinical significance of DLBCL patients were performed with the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, GENEMANIA, and web-based software including cBioPortal and WebGestalt. To examine the therapeutic effect of Chidamide, DLBCL cell lines (WSU-DLCL-2 and DB cells) were employed. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed with Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry assays. The impact of Chidamide treatment was also analyzed by RNA sequencing of treated DB cells. Western blot was used to explore the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxicity of Chidamide on DLBCL cell lines. The expression of some HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9) were significantly higher in the lymph node samples of DLBCL than that in whole-blood-cell controls. Moreover, we found that the mutation rate of HDACs was also higher in DLBCL tissues, although the overall survival of DLBCL patients was not associated with HDAC expression. Chidamide was found to have a cytotoxic effect on DLBCL cells in a dose-dependent manner, while transcriptome analysis and western blot revealed that using it for treatment impacted several biological processes, including PI3K/AKT signaling, mTOR signaling, the cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways. Alterations of HDAC genes, including enhanced expression and mutations, are positively related to DLBCL. Targeting HDACs with specific inhibitors such as Chidamide may represent a potential therapeutic approach for DLBCL patients."
oncology,The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway drives CD24-mediated immune evasion in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via macrophage phagocytosis,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-023-02923-z,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies in the world with poor prognosis. Despite the promising applications of immunotherapy, the objective response rate is still unsatisfactory. We have previously shown that Hippo/YAP signaling acts as a powerful tumor promoter in ESCC. However, whether Hippo/YAP signaling is involved in tumor immune escape in ESCC remains largely unknown. Here, we show that YAP directly activates transcription of the “don’t eat me” signal CD24, and plays a crucial role in driving tumor cells to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages. Mechanistically, YAP regulates CD24 expression by interacting with TEAD and binding the CD24 promoter to initiate transcription, which facilitates tumor cell escape from macrophage-mediated immune attack. Our animal model data and clinical data show that YAP combined with CD24 in tumor microenvironment redefines the impact of TAMs on the prognosis of ESCC patients which will provide a valuable basis for precision medicine. Moreover, treatment with YAP inhibitor altered the distribution of macrophages and suppressed tumorigenesis and progression of ESCC in vivo. Together, our study provides a novel link between Hippo/YAP signaling and macrophage-mediated immune escape, which suggests that the Hippo-YAP-CD24 axis may act as a promising target to improve the prognosis of ESCC patients.A proposed model for the regulatory mechanism of Hippo-YAP-CD24-signaling axis in the tumor-associated macrophages mediated immune escape."
oncology,Vocal fold leukoplakia recurrence risk model,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50691-3,"The paper aims to define the variables that elevate the risk of VFL recurrence after adequate primary treatment, and to present the Recurrence Risk Model with practical conclusions to handle pVFL and rVFL. Out of 207 patients with primary vocal fold leukoplakia (pVFL), in 41 (19.8%) recurrent VFL (rVFL) was diagnosed. All patients were assessed by using a trans-nasal flexible video-endoscope using white light, and NBI. The primary measure of our study was to investigate whether morphological features of pVFL in WL, vascular pattern in NBI, and primary histological findings could predict VFL recurrence. To create a model of risk factors, two methods were used: logistic regression and a conditional inference decision tree. The study showed smoking was the factor that significantly and most strongly increased the likelihood of rVFL, as well as the older age groups have a greater odds of rVFL. Types IV, V and VI, according to Ni 2019 classification, were associated with a significantly higher risk of rVFL. The algorithm combining patients’ dependent variables and the combination of two classifications improves the predictive value of the presented VFL Recurrence Risk Model."
oncology,Whole‑exome sequencing reveals Lewis lung carcinoma is a hypermutated Kras/Nras–mutant cancer with extensive regional mutation clusters in its genome,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50703-2,"Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), as a widely used preclinical cancer model, has still not been genetically and genomically characterized. Here, we performed a whole–exome sequencing analysis on the LLC cell line to elucidate its molecular characteristics and etiologies. Our data showed that LLC originated from a male mouse belonging to C57BL/6L (a transitional strain between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N) and contains substantial somatic SNV and InDel mutations (> 20,000). Extensive regional mutation clusters are present in its genome, which were caused mainly by the mutational processes underlying the SBS1, SBS5, SBS15, SBS17a, and SBS21 signatures during frequent structural rearrangements. Thirty three deleterious mutations are present in 30 cancer genes including Kras, Nras, Trp53, Dcc, and Cacna1d. Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b are biallelically deleted from the genome. Five pathways (RTK/RAS, p53, cell cycle, TGFB, and Hippo) are oncogenically deregulated or affected. The major mutational processes in LLC include chromosomal instability, exposure to metabolic mutagens, spontaneous 5–methylcytosine deamination, defective DNA mismatch repair, and reactive oxygen species. Our data also suggest that LLC is a lung cancer similar to human lung adenocarcinoma. This study lays a molecular basis for the more targeted application of LLC in preclinical research."
oncology,ZNF689 deficiency promotes intratumor heterogeneity and immunotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00909-w,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease characterized by remarkable intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which poses therapeutic challenges. However, the clinical relevance and key determinant of ITH in TNBC are poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively characterized ITH levels using multi-omics data across our center’s cohort (n = 260), The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (n = 134), and four immunotherapy-treated cohorts (n = 109). Our results revealed that high ITH was associated with poor patient survival and immunotherapy resistance. Importantly, we identified zinc finger protein 689 (ZNF689) deficiency as a crucial determinant of ITH formation. Mechanistically, the ZNF689–TRIM28 complex was found to directly bind to the promoter of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1), inducing H3K9me3-mediated transcriptional silencing. ZNF689 deficiency reactivated LINE-1 retrotransposition to exacerbate genomic instability, which fostered ITH. Single-cell RNA sequencing, spatially resolved transcriptomics and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that ZNF689 deficiency-induced ITH inhibited antigen presentation and T-cell activation, conferring immunotherapy resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of LINE-1 significantly reduced ITH, enhanced antitumor immunity, and eventually sensitized ZNF689-deficient tumors to immunotherapy in vivo. Consistently, ZNF689 expression positively correlated with favorable prognosis and immunotherapy response in clinical samples. Altogether, our study uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying ZNF689 deficiency-induced ITH and suggests LINE-1 inhibition combined with immunotherapy as a novel treatment strategy for TNBC."
oncology,cGAS-STING pathway expression correlates with genomic instability and immune cell infiltration in breast cancer,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-023-00609-z,"Genomic instability, as caused by oncogene-induced replication stress, can lead to the activation of inflammatory signaling, involving the cGAS-STING and JAK-STAT pathways. Inflammatory signaling has been associated with pro-tumorigenic features, but also with favorable response to treatment, including to immune checkpoint inhibition. In this study, we aim to explore relations between inflammatory signaling, markers of replication stress, and immune cell infiltration in breast cancer. Expression levels of cGAS-STING signaling components (STING, phospho-TBK1, and phospho-STAT1), replication stress markers (γH2AX and pRPA), replication stress-related proto-oncogenes (Cyclin E1 and c-Myc) and immune cell markers (CD20, CD4, and CD57) are determined immunohistochemically on primary breast cancer samples (n = 380). RNA-sequencing data from TCGA (n = 1082) and METABRIC (n = 1904) are used to calculate cGAS-STING scores. pTBK1, pSTAT1 expression and cGAS-STING pathway scores are all increased in triple-negative breast cancers compared to other subtypes. Expression of γH2AX, pRPA, Cyclin E1, c-Myc, and immune cell infiltration positively correlate with p-STAT1 expression (P < 0.001). Additionally, we observe significant positive associations between expression of pTBK1 and γH2AX, pRPA, c-Myc, and number of CD4+ cells and CD20+ cells. Also, cGAS-STING scores are correlated with genomic instability metrics, such as homologous recombination deficiency (P < 0.001) and tumor mutational burden (P < 0.01). Moreover, data from the I-SPY2 clinical trial (n = 71) confirms that higher cGAS-STING scores are observed in breast cancer patients who responded to immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. In conclusion, the cGAS-STING pathway is highly expressed in TNBCs and is correlated with genomic instability and immune cell infiltration."
lymphoma,Blocking methionine catabolism induces senescence and confers vulnerability to GSK3 inhibition in liver cancer,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00671-3,"Availability of the essential amino acid methionine affects cellular metabolism and growth, and dietary methionine restriction has been implicated as a cancer therapeutic strategy. Nevertheless, how liver cancer cells respond to methionine deprivation and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we find that human liver cancer cells undergo irreversible cell cycle arrest upon methionine deprivation in vitro. Blocking methionine adenosyl transferase 2A (MAT2A)-dependent methionine catabolism induces cell cycle arrest and DNA damage in liver cancer cells, resulting in cellular senescence. A pharmacological screen further identified GSK3 inhibitors as senolytics that selectively kill MAT2A-inhibited senescent liver cancer cells. Importantly, combined treatment with MAT2A and GSK3 inhibitors therapeutically blunts liver tumor growth in vitro and in vivo across multiple models. Together, methionine catabolism is essential for liver tumor growth, and its inhibition can be exploited as an improved pro-senescence strategy for combination with senolytic agents to treat liver cancer."
lymphoma,Development of a novel prediction model for differential diagnosis between spinal myxopapillary ependymoma and schwannoma,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50806-w,"Spinal myxopapillary ependymoma (MPE) and schwannoma represent clinically distinct intradural extramedullary tumors, albeit with shared and overlapping magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics. We aimed to identify significant MRI features that can differentiate between MPE and schwannoma and develop a novel prediction model using these features. In this study, 77 patients with MPE (n = 24) or schwannoma (n = 53) who underwent preoperative MRI and surgical removal between January 2012 and December 2022 were included. MRI features, including intratumoral T2 dark signals, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), leptomeningeal seeding, and enhancement patterns, were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to distinguish between MPE and schwannomas based on MRI parameters, and a prediction model was developed using significant MRI parameters. The model was validated internally using a stratified tenfold cross-validation. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated based on the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. MPEs had a significantly larger mean size (p = 0.0035), higher frequency of intratumoral T2 dark signals (p = 0.0021), associated SAH (p = 0.0377), and leptomeningeal seeding (p = 0.0377). Focal and diffuse heterogeneous enhancement patterns were significantly more common in MPEs (p = 0.0049 and 0.0038, respectively). Multivariable analyses showed that intratumoral T2 dark signal (p = 0.0439) and focal (p = 0.0029) and diffuse enhancement patterns (p = 0.0398) were independent factors. The prediction model showed an AUC of 0.9204 (95% CI 0.8532–0.9876) and the average AUC for internal validation was 0.9210 (95% CI 0.9160–0.9270). MRI provides useful data for differentiating spinal MPEs from schwannomas. The prediction model developed based on the MRI features demonstrated excellent discriminatory performance."
lymphoma,Distinct patterns of proteostasis network gene expression are associated with different prognoses in melanoma patients,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50640-0,"The proteostasis network (PN) is a collection of protein folding and degradation pathways that spans cellular compartments and acts to preserve the integrity of the proteome. The differential expression of PN genes is a hallmark of many cancers, and the inhibition of protein quality control factors is an effective way to slow cancer cell growth. However, little is known about how the expression of PN genes differs between patients and how this impacts survival outcomes. To address this, we applied unbiased hierarchical clustering to gene expression data obtained from primary and metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM) samples and found that two distinct groups of individuals emerge across each sample type. These patient groups are distinguished by the differential expression of genes encoding ATP-dependent and ATP-independent chaperones, and proteasomal subunits. Differences in PN gene expression were associated with increased levels of the transcription factors, MEF2A, SP4, ZFX, CREB1 and ATF2, as well as markedly different survival outcomes. However, surprisingly, similar PN alterations in primary and metastatic samples were associated with discordant survival outcomes in patients. Our findings reveal that the expression of PN genes demarcates CM patients and highlights several new proteostasis sub-networks that could be targeted for more effective suppression of CM within specific individuals."
lymphoma,IL-10-expressing CAR T cells resist dysfunction and mediate durable clearance of solid tumors and metastases,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02060-8,"The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in treating several hematopoietic malignancies has been difficult to replicate in solid tumors, in part because of T cell exhaustion and eventually dysfunction. To counter T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment, we metabolically armored CAR T cells by engineering them to secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10). We show that IL-10 CAR T cells preserve intact mitochondrial structure and function in the tumor microenvironment and increase oxidative phosphorylation in a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier-dependent manner. IL-10 secretion promoted proliferation and effector function of CAR T cells, leading to complete regression of established solid tumors and metastatic cancers across several cancer types in syngeneic and xenograft mouse models, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer. IL-10 CAR T cells also induced stem cell-like memory responses in lymphoid organs that imparted durable protection against tumor rechallenge. Our results establish a generalizable approach to counter CAR T cell dysfunction through metabolic armoring, leading to solid tumor eradication and long-lasting immune protection."
lymphoma,IL-12 reprograms CAR-expressing natural killer T cells to long-lived Th1-polarized cells with potent antitumor activity,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44310-y,"Human natural killer T cells (NKTs) are innate-like T lymphocytes increasingly used for cancer immunotherapy. Here we show that human NKTs expressing the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) undergo extensive and sustained molecular and functional reprogramming. Specifically, IL-12 instructs and maintains a Th1-polarization program in NKTs in vivo without causing their functional exhaustion. Furthermore, using CD62L as a marker of memory cells in human NKTs, we observe that IL-12 maintains long-term CD62L-expressing memory NKTs in vivo. Notably, IL-12 initiates a de novo programming of memory NKTs in CD62L-negative NKTs indicating that human NKTs circulating in the peripheral blood possess an intrinsic differentiation hierarchy, and that IL-12 plays a role in promoting their differentiation to long-lived Th1-polarized memory cells. Human NKTs engineered to co-express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) coupled with the expression of IL-12 show enhanced antitumor activity in leukemia and neuroblastoma tumor models, persist long-term in vivo and conserve the molecular signature driven by the IL-12 expression. Thus IL-12 reveals an intrinsic plasticity of peripheral human NKTs that may play a crucial role in the development of cell therapeutics."
lymphoma,Integrated whole transcriptome profiling revealed a convoluted circular RNA-based competing endogenous RNAs regulatory network in colorectal cancer,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50230-0,"Recently, it has been identified that circRNAs can act as miRNA sponge to regulate gene expression in various types of cancers, associating them with cancer initiation and progression. The present study aims to identify colorectal cancer-related circRNAs and the underpinning mechanisms of circRNA/miRNA/mRNA networks in the development and progress of Colorectal Cancer. Differentially expressed circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were identified in GEO microarray datasets using the Limma package of R. The analysis of differentially expressed circRNAs resulted in 23 upregulated and 31 downregulated circRNAs. CeRNAs networks were constructed by intersecting the results of predicted and experimentally validated databases, circbank and miRWalk, and by performing DEMs and DEGs analysis using Cytoscape. Next, functional enrichment analysis was performed for DEGs included in ceRNA networks. Followed by survival analysis, expression profile assessment using TCGA and GEO data, and ROC curve analysis we identified a ceRNA sub-networks that revealed the potential regulatory effect of hsa_circ_0001955 and hsa_circ_0071681 on survival-related genes, namely KLF4, MYC, CCNA2, RACGAP1, and CD44. Overall, we constructed a convoluted regulatory network and outlined its likely mechanisms of action in CRC, which may contribute to the development of more effective approaches for early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of CRC."

Due to constraints of short-read sequencing, current methods to detect natural genetic barcodes often require cumbersome primer panels and early commitment to targets. Here we devise a flexible long-read sequencing workflow and analysis pipeline, termed nanoranger, that starts from intermediate single-cell cDNA libraries to detect cell lineage-defining features, including single-nucleotide variants, fusion genes, isoforms, sequences of chimeric antigen and TCRs. Through systematic analysis of these classes of natural ‘barcodes’, we define the optimal targets for nanoranger, namely those loci close to the 5’ end of highly expressed genes with transcript lengths shorter than 4 kB. As proof-of-concept, we apply nanoranger to longitudinal tracking of subclones of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and describe the heterogeneous isoform landscape of thousands of marrow-infiltrating immune cells. We propose that enhanced cellular genotyping using nanoranger can improve the tracking of single-cell tumor and immune cell co-evolution."

Despite these recognized applications by natives and tribals, comprehensive insight into its biological activities and chemical composition remains limited. This study aimed to explore the cytotoxic potential of sequentially extracted leaf extracts from Dalbergia sissoo using various solvents, aiming to unveil the array of phytochemicals through LC–MS profiling. Among the extracts evaluated, the extract employing methanol:water extracting media (HN-2) appeared with the most remarkable results in both phytochemical diversity and biological activity. Furthermore, in vitro results of HN-2's in vitro anticancer efficacy were confirmed through in silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. These analyses demonstrated its ability to inhibit C-ABL kinase within leukemia K562 cells, directing that Dalbergia sissoo leaves serve as a bioactive agent reservoir. Consequently, this suggests that the Dalbergia sissoo plant is a potential source of bioactive compounds that can be used as a precursor for developing new cancer inhibitors, mainly targeting leukemia."

However, existing cell annotation methods utilizing high-plex spatial proteomics data are resource intensive and necessitate iterative expert input, thereby constraining their scalability and practicality for extensive datasets. We introduce MAPS (Machine learning for Analysis of Proteomics in Spatial biology), a machine learning approach facilitating rapid and precise cell type identification with human-level accuracy from spatial proteomics data. Validated on multiple in-house and publicly available MIBI and CODEX datasets, MAPS outperforms current annotation techniques in terms of speed and accuracy, achieving pathologist-level precision even for typically challenging cell types, including tumor cells of immune origin. By democratizing rapidly deployable and scalable machine learning annotation, MAPS holds significant potential to expedite advances in tissue biology and disease comprehension."

In this phase II trial (NCT01613300), we investigated safety and effectiveness of OFA-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). High-risk B-cell NHL patients with chemorrefractory disease or post-autologous SCT relapse were eligible. OFA was added to a standard RIC regimen. Primary endpoint was grade 3-4 aGVHD rate, while secondary endpoints included CR and survival rates. Thirty-three patients were included (median age 51; diffuse large B-cell:68%, HLA-identical donor: 74%). No grade >2 OFA toxicity was observed. Acute GVHD affected 77% of patients (16% grade 3-4). Remarkably, GVHD achieved CR in 75% of patients after first-line treatment. Chronic GVHD, primarily mild or moderate, occurred in 54% of patients. NHL CR rate at day +100 was 81%. Relapses occurred in 7 patients after a median of 3 months. Causes of death were lymphoma progression (5), infections (10), and GVHD (2). At 24 months, progression-free and overall survival rates were 50.1 and 51.6% respectively. OFA-RIC regimen is safe and effective, though acute GVHD remains a significant complication. However, data suggest that OFA could mitigate its severity."
lymphoma,Pharmaceutical targeting of OTUB2 sensitizes tumors to cytotoxic T cells via degradation of PD-L1,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44466-7,"PD-1 is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed by CD8+ T cells which limits their cytotoxicity. PD-L1 expression on cancer cells contributes to immune evasion by cancers, thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate PD-L1 protein levels in cancers is important. Here we identify tumor-cell-expressed otubain-2 (OTUB2) as a negative regulator of antitumor immunity, acting through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in various human cancers. Mechanistically, OTUB2 directly interacts with PD-L1 to disrupt the ubiquitination and degradation of PD-L1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. Genetic deletion of OTUB2 markedly decreases the expression of PD-L1 proteins on the tumor cell surface, resulting in increased tumor cell sensitivity to CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. To underscore relevance in human patients, we observe a significant correlation between OTUB2 expression and PD-L1 abundance in human non-small cell lung cancer. An inhibitor of OTUB2, interfering with its deubiquitinase activity without disrupting the OTUB2-PD-L1 interaction, successfully reduces PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and suppressed tumor growth. Together, these results reveal the roles of OTUB2 in PD-L1 regulation and tumor evasion and lays down the proof of principle for OTUB2 targeting as therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment."
lymphoma,Structure-guided design of a selective inhibitor of the methyltransferase KMT9 with cellular activity,2024-01-02,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44243-6,"Inhibition of epigenetic regulators by small molecules is an attractive strategy for cancer treatment. Recently, we characterised the role of lysine methyltransferase 9 (KMT9) in prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our observation that the enzymatic activity was required for tumour cell proliferation identified KMT9 as a potential therapeutic target. Here, we report the development of a potent and selective KMT9 inhibitor (compound 4, KMI169) with cellular activity through structure-based drug design. KMI169 functions as a bi-substrate inhibitor targeting the SAM and substrate binding pockets of KMT9 and exhibits high potency, selectivity, and cellular target engagement. KMT9 inhibition selectively downregulates target genes involved in cell cycle regulation and impairs proliferation of tumours cells including castration- and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. KMI169 represents a valuable tool to probe cellular KMT9 functions and paves the way for the development of clinical candidate inhibitors as therapeutic options to treat malignancies such as therapy-resistant prostate cancer."

In this study, we examined the expression levels, mutations, and clinical significance of HDACs in DLBCL. Additionally, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Chidamide, a novel HDAC inhibitor, to provide scientific evidence for targeting HDACs in DLBCL patients. We extracted transcriptome data of DLBCLs––including 47 lymph node samples and 337 whole-blood-cell controls––from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Bioinformatic analyses of HDAC expression, mutation, and correlation with the clinical significance of DLBCL patients were performed with the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, GENEMANIA, and web-based software including cBioPortal and WebGestalt. To examine the therapeutic effect of Chidamide, DLBCL cell lines (WSU-DLCL-2 and DB cells) were employed. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed with Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry assays. The impact of Chidamide treatment was also analyzed by RNA sequencing of treated DB cells. Western blot was used to explore the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxicity of Chidamide on DLBCL cell lines. The expression of some HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9) were significantly higher in the lymph node samples of DLBCL than that in whole-blood-cell controls. Moreover, we found that the mutation rate of HDACs was also higher in DLBCL tissues, although the overall survival of DLBCL patients was not associated with HDAC expression. Chidamide was found to have a cytotoxic effect on DLBCL cells in a dose-dependent manner, while transcriptome analysis and western blot revealed that using it for treatment impacted several biological processes, including PI3K/AKT signaling, mTOR signaling, the cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways. Alterations of HDAC genes, including enhanced expression and mutations, are positively related to DLBCL. Targeting HDACs with specific inhibitors such as Chidamide may represent a potential therapeutic approach for DLBCL patients."

Here, we characterize the rates and spectrum of somatic TFs across >30 cancer types using whole-genome sequencing data. TFs are pervasive in human tumours with rates varying markedly across and within cancer types. In addition to end-to-end fusions, we find patterns of TFs that we mechanistically link to the activity of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. We show that TFs can be detected in the blood of cancer patients, which enables cancer detection with high specificity and sensitivity even for early-stage tumours and cancers of high unmet clinical need. Overall, we report a genomic footprint that enables characterization of the telomere maintenance mechanism of tumours and liquid biopsy analysis."
lymphoma,Bacteria and bacteriophage consortia are associated with protective intestinal metabolites in patients receiving stem cell transplantation,2024-01-03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00669-x,"The microbiome is a predictor of clinical outcome in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Microbiota-derived metabolites can modulate these outcomes. How bacteria, fungi and viruses contribute to the production of intestinal metabolites is still unclear. We combined amplicon sequencing, viral metagenomics and targeted metabolomics from stool samples of patients receiving allo-SCT (n = 78) and uncovered a microbiome signature of Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae and their associated bacteriophages, correlating with the production of immunomodulatory metabolites (IMMs). Moreover, we established the IMM risk index (IMM-RI), which was associated with improved survival and reduced relapse. A high abundance of short-chain fatty acid-biosynthesis pathways, specifically butyric acid via butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA):acetate CoA-transferase (BCoAT, which catalyzes EC 2.8.3.8) was detected in IMM-RI low-risk patients, and virome genome assembly identified two bacteriophages encoding BCoAT as an auxiliary metabolic gene. In conclusion, our study identifies a microbiome signature associated with protective IMMs and provides a rationale for considering metabolite-producing consortia and metabolite formulations as microbiome-based therapies."
lymphoma,Colorectal cancer with low SLC35A3 is associated with immune infiltrates and poor prognosis,2024-01-03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-51028-w,"The expression level of SLC35A3 is associated with the prognosis of many cancers, but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. The purpose of our study was to elucidate the role of SLC35A3 in CRC. The expression levels of SLC35A3 in CRC were evaluated through tumor immune resource assessment (TIMER), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemical evaluation. TCGA, GEO, and ICGC databases were used to analyze the diagnostic and prognostic value of SLC35A3 in CRC. A overall survival (OS) model was constructed and validated based on the expression level of SLC35A3 and multivariable analysis results. The cBioPortal tool was used to analyze SLC35A3 mutation in CRC. The UALCAN tool was used to analyze the promoter methylation level of SLC35A3 in colorectal cancer. In addition, the role of SLC35A3 in CRC was determined through GO analysis, KEGG analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), immune infiltration analysis, and immune checkpoint correlation analysis. In vitro experiments validated the function of SLC35A3 in colorectal cancer cells. Compared with adjacent normal tissues and colonic epithelial cells, the expression of SLC35A3 was decreased in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines. Low expression of SLC35A3 was associated with N stage, pathological stage, and lymphatic infiltration, and it was unfavorable for OS, disease-specific survival (DSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and post-progression survival (PPS). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, SLC35A3 is a potential important diagnostic biomarker for CRC patients. The nomograph based on the expression level of SLC35A3 showed a better predictive model for OS than single prognostic factors and TNM staging. SLC35A3 has multiple types of mutations in CRC, and its promoter methylation level is significantly decreased. GO and KEGG analysis indicated that SLC35A3 may be involved in transmembrane transport protein activity, cell communication, and interaction with neurotransmitter receptors. GSEA revealed that SLC35A3 may be involved in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cancer pathways. In addition, SLC35A3 was closely related to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the positive correlation between SLC35A3 and helper T cell infiltration. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of SLC35A3 inhibited the proliferation and invasion capability of colorectal cancer cells and promoted apoptosis. The results of this study indicate that decreased expression of SLC35A3 is closely associated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration in colorectal cancer, and it can serve as a promising independent prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target."
lymphoma,GIMAP5 deficiency reveals a mammalian ceramide-driven longevity assurance pathway,2024-01-03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01691-y,"Preserving cells in a functional, non-senescent state is a major goal for extending human healthspans. Model organisms reveal that longevity and senescence are genetically controlled, but how genes control longevity in different mammalian tissues is unknown. Here, we report a new human genetic disease that causes cell senescence, liver and immune dysfunction, and early mortality that results from deficiency of GIMAP5, an evolutionarily conserved GTPase selectively expressed in lymphocytes and endothelial cells. We show that GIMAP5 restricts the pathological accumulation of long-chain ceramides (CERs), thereby regulating longevity. GIMAP5 controls CER abundance by interacting with protein kinase CK2 (CK2), attenuating its ability to activate CER synthases. Inhibition of CK2 and CER synthase rescues GIMAP5-deficient T cells by preventing CER overaccumulation and cell deterioration. Thus, GIMAP5 controls longevity assurance pathways crucial for immune function and healthspan in mammals."
lymphoma,Group I pharmaceuticals of IARC and associated cancer risks: systematic review and meta-analysis,2024-01-03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50602-6,"We aimed to summarize the cancer risk among patients with indication of group I pharmaceuticals as stated in monographs presented by the International Agency for Research on Cancer working groups. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. Pharmaceuticals with few studies on cancer risk were identified in systematic reviews; those with two or more studies were subjected to meta-analysis. For the meta-analysis, a random-effects model was used to calculate the summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Heterogeneity across studies was presented using the Higgins I square value from Cochran’s Q test. Among the 12 group I pharmaceuticals selected, three involved a single study [etoposide, thiotepa, and mustargen + oncovin + procarbazine + prednisone (MOPP)], seven had two or more studies [busulfan, cyclosporine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methoxsalen + ultraviolet (UV) radiation therapy, melphalan, and chlorambucil], and two did not have any studies [etoposide + bleomycin + cisplatin and treosulfan]. Cyclosporine and azathioprine reported increased skin cancer risk (SRR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07–1.62; SRR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.25–1.93) compared to non-use. Cyclophosphamide increased bladder and hematologic cancer risk (SRR = 2.87, 95% CI 1.32–6.23; SRR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.65–3.58). Busulfan increased hematologic cancer risk (SRR = 6.71, 95% CI 2.49–18.08); melphalan was associated with hematologic cancer (SRR = 4.43, 95% CI 1.30–15.15). In the systematic review, methoxsalen + UV and MOPP were associated with an increased risk of skin and lung cancer, respectively. Our results can enhance persistent surveillance of group I pharmaceutical use, establish novel clinical strategies for patients with indications, and provide evidence for re-categorizing current group I pharmaceuticals into other groups."
lymphoma,Pan-cancer analyses of the associations between 109 pre-existing conditions and cancer treatment patterns across 19 adult cancers,2024-01-03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51161-0,"Comorbidities present considerable challenges to cancer treatment and care. However, little is known about the effect of comorbidity on cancer treatment decisions across a wide range of cancer types and treatment modalities. Harnessing a cohort of 280,543 patients spanning 19 site-specific cancers, we explored pan-cancer frequencies of 109 comorbidities. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between comorbidities and cancer treatment types, while binomial logistic regression examined the association between comorbidities and chemotherapy drug types, adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. Patients with comorbidity exhibited lower odds of receiving chemotherapy and multimodality treatment. End-stage renal disease was significantly associated with a decreased odds of receiving chemotherapy and surgery. Patients with prostate cancer who have comorbid non-acute cystitis, obstructive and reflux uropathy, urolithiasis, or hypertension were less likely to receive chemotherapy. Among patients with breast cancer, dementia, left bundle branch block, peripheral arterial disease, epilepsy, Barrett’s oesophagus, ischaemic stroke, unstable angina and asthma were associated with lower odds of receiving multimodal chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Comorbidity is also consistently associated with the lower odds of receiving chemotherapy when comparing across 10 drug classes. Patients with comorbid dementia, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, oesophageal varices, liver fibrosis sclerosis and cirrhosis and secondary pulmonary hypertension were less likely to receive antimetabolites. Comorbidity can influence the effectiveness and tolerability of cancer treatment and ultimately, prognosis. Multi-specialty collaborative care is essential for the management of comorbidity during cancer treatment, including prophylactic measures to manage toxicities."
lymphoma,Prognostic value of mitochondrial CKMT2 in Pan-cancer and its tumor immune correlation analysis,2024-01-03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-46468-3,"Mitochondrial metabolism has been shown to play a key role in immune cell survival and function, but mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (CKMT2) has been relatively little studied about tumor immunity. We aimed to explore the prognostic value of CKMT2 in 33 cancer types and investigate its potential immune function. We used a range of bioinformatics approaches to explore the potential carcinogenic role of CKMT2 in multiple cancers. CKMT2 was lowly expressed in 14 tumor tissues and highly expressed in 4 tumor tissues. Immunohistochemical assays showed overexpression of CKMT2 in colon cancer and rectal cancer. CKMT2 overexpression was positively correlated with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer. CKMT2 overexpression is mainly enriched in the adaptive immune system and immune regulatory pathways of immunoglobulins. Seven cancers were positively correlated with low CKMT2 expression in tumor microenvironment analysis. Among the five cancers, low expression of CKMT2 resulted in better immunotherapy treatment outcomes. There was a strong correlation between CKMT2 and most immune-related genes in specific cancer types. CKMT2 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer immunity and can be used as a prognostic biomarker and potential target for cancer immunotherapy."
lymphoma,RNF31 promotes proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma via nuclear factor kappaB activation,2024-01-03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50594-3,"RNF31 is a multifunctional RING finger protein implicated in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. It functions as a core component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which activates the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) pathway via the generation of the Met1-linked linear ubiquitin chain. We aimed to clarify the role of RNF31 in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its relevance as a therapeutic target. High RNF31 expression in HCC, assessed by both immunohistochemistry and mRNA levels, was related to worse survival rates among patients with HCC. In vitro experiments showed that RNF31 knockdown in HCC cell lines led to decreased cell proliferation and invasion, as well as suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced NF-κB activation. Treatment with HOIPIN-8, a specific LUBAC inhibitor that suppresses RNF31 ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity, showed similar effects, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and invasion. Our clinical and in vitro data showed that RNF31 is a prognostic factor for HCC that promotes tumor aggressiveness via NF-κB activation."

Targeting immune niches may ameliorate disease progression and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance in Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-ALL (Ph+ B-ALL). Here, we show that T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and IL-17A expression are distinctively elevated in Ph+ B-ALL patients. IL-17A promotes the progression of Ph+ B-ALL. Mechanistically, IL-17A activates BCR-ABL, IL6/JAK/STAT3, and NF-kB signalling pathways in Ph+ B-ALL cells, resulting in robust cell proliferation and survival. In addition, IL-17A-activated Ph+ B-ALL cells secrete the chemokine CXCL16, which in turn promotes Th17 differentiation, attracts Th17 cells and forms a positive feedback loop supporting leukemia progression. These data demonstrate an involvement of Th17 cells in Ph+ B-ALL progression and suggest potential therapeutic options for Ph+ B-ALL with Th17-enriched niches."

Therefore, we assessed the impact of MYC-R on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in LS DLBCL patients at the population level. We identified 1,434 LS DLBCL patients with known MYC-R status diagnosed between 2014 and 2020, who received R-CHOP(-like) regimens using the Netherlands Cancer Registry, with survival follow-up until February 2022. Stage I patients with (n = 83, 11%) and without (n = 650, 89%) a MYC-R had similar 2-years PFS (89% and 93%, p = 0.63) and OS (both 95%, p = 0.22). Conversely, stage II DLBCL patients with a MYC-R (n = 90, 13%) had inferior survival outcomes compared to stage II patients without a MYC-R (n = 611, 87%) (PFS 70% vs. 89%, p = 0.001; OS 79% vs. 94%, p < 0.0001). Both single MYC-R (single hit, n = 36) and concurrent BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (double/triple hit, n = 39) were associated with increased mortality and relapse risk. In conclusion, in stage II DLBCL a MYC-R is negatively associated with survival. In stage I DLBCL, however, survival outcomes are excellent irrespective of MYC-R status. This challenges the diagnostic assessment of MYC-R in stage I DLBCL patients."
lymphoma,DCAF1-based PROTACs with activity against clinically validated targets overcoming intrinsic- and acquired-degrader resistance,2024-01-04,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44237-4,"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) mediates protein level through small molecule induced redirection of E3 ligases to ubiquitinate neo-substrates and mark them for proteasomal degradation. TPD has recently emerged as a key modality in drug discovery. So far only a few ligases have been utilized for TPD. Interestingly, the workhorse ligase CRBN has been observed to be downregulated in settings of resistance to immunomodulatory inhibitory drugs (IMiDs). Here we show that the essential E3 ligase receptor DCAF1 can be harnessed for TPD utilizing a selective, non-covalent DCAF1 binder. We confirm that this binder can be functionalized into an efficient DCAF1-BRD9 PROTAC. Chemical and genetic rescue experiments validate specific degradation via the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ligase. Additionally, a dasatinib-based DCAF1 PROTAC successfully degrades cytosolic and membrane-bound tyrosine kinases. A potent and selective DCAF1-BTK-PROTAC (DBt-10) degrades BTK in cells with acquired resistance to CRBN-BTK-PROTACs while the DCAF1-BRD9 PROTAC (DBr-1) provides an alternative strategy to tackle intrinsic resistance to VHL-degrader, highlighting DCAF1-PROTACS as a promising strategy to overcome ligase mediated resistance in clinical settings."

This particular shape is important for increased osmotic resistance and stability. Age-related changes in the RBC count are known in other species, with alterations in both red and white blood cells being described. In alpacas, there are few data on age-related changes, and only a comparison of crias with adult animals. We characterized age-related hematologic changes in a study of 21 female alpacas from a research herd. A total of 87 records of clinically healthy alpacas of different ages were statistically analyzed retrospectively from the hematologic records over a nine-year period. Significant positive correlations of age with hemoglobin (Hb), HCT, MCV, MCH, neutrophils, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were found as well as significant negative correlations of age with lymphocytes in addition to lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). A paired comparison of eight older animals in the herd at three different ages also showed significant differences in the parameters Hb, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils. Similar changes in hematologic parameters have been reported in other species and should be taken into account when interpreting hematologic results in alpacas."

We examined resistance to BRAF inhibition by single CTC sequencing in BRAFV600E-mutant NSCLC.MethodsCTCs and cfDNA were examined in seven BRAFV600E-mutant NSCLC patients at failure to treatment. Matched tumour tissue was available for four patients. Single CTCs were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting following enrichment and immunofluorescence (Hoechst 33342/CD45/pan-cytokeratins) and sequenced for mutation and copy number-alteration (CNA) analyses.ResultsBRAFV600E was found in 4/4 tumour biopsies and 5/7 cfDNA samples. CTC mutations were mostly found in MAPK-independent pathways and only 1/26 CTCs were BRAFV600E mutated. CTC profiles encompassed the majority of matched tumour biopsy CNAs but 72.5% to 84.5% of CTC CNAs were exclusive to CTCs. Extensive diversity, involving MAPK, MAPK-related, cell cycle, DNA repair and immune response pathways, was observed in CTCs and missed by analyses on tumour biopsies and cfDNA. Driver alterations in clinically relevant genes were recurrent in CTCs.ConclusionsResistance was not driven by BRAFV600E-mutant CTCs. Extensive tumour genomic heterogeneity was found in CTCs compared to tumour biopsies and cfDNA at failure to BRAF inhibition, in BRAFV600E-mutant NSCLC, including relevant alterations that may represent potential treatment opportunities."

There is, however, paucity of data to show if ptCy impacts chronic GVHD pathogenesis, its phenotype and evolution after HCT regardless of the donor status. We examined the differences in chronic GVHD incidence and presentation in 314 consecutive patients after receiving their first allogeneic transplantation (HCT) using ptCy-based GVHD prophylaxis (ptCy-HCT; n = 120; including 95 with haploidentical related donor) versus conventional calcineurin inhibitor-based prophylaxis (CNI-MUD; n = 194) between 2012 and 2019. The 1-year cumulative incidence of all-grade chronic GVHD and moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 24% and 12%, respectively, after ptCy-HCT and 40% and 23% in the CNI-MUD recipients (p = 0.0003 and 0.007). Multivariable analysis confirmed that use of CNI-based GVHD prophylaxis and peripheral blood stem cell graft as the risk factors for chronic GVHD. The cumulative incidence of visceral (involving ≥1 of the following organs: liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, serous membranes) chronic GVHD was significantly higher with CNI-MUD vs. ptCy-HCT (27% vs. 15% at 1 year, p = 0.009). The incidence of moderate/severe visceral chronic GVHD was 20% in CNI-MUD group vs. 7.7% in the ptCy-HCT group at 1 year (p = 0.002). In addition, significantly fewer ptCy-HCT recipients developed severe chronic GVHD in ≥3 organs (0.8%) vs. 8.8% in the CNI-MUD group at 1-year posttransplant (p = 0.004). There was no significant different in relapse, non-relapse mortality, and relapse-free and overall survival between the two groups. Further investigation is needed to confirm that reduced risk and severity of chronic GVHD, less visceral organ distribution with ptCy-HCT leads to improved quality of life."
lymphoma,Transcriptomic analysis identifies B-lymphocyte kinase as a therapeutic target for desmoplastic small round cell tumor cancer stem cell-like cells,2024-01-04,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41389-023-00504-z,"Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive pediatric cancer caused by the EWSR1-WT1 fusion oncoprotein. The tumor is refractory to treatment with a 5-year survival rate of only 15–25%, necessitating the development of novel therapeutics, especially those able to target chemoresistant subpopulations. Novel in vitro cancer stem cell-like (CSC-like) culture conditions increase the expression of stemness markers (SOX2, NANOG) and reduce DSRCT cell line susceptibility to chemotherapy while maintaining the ability of DSRCT cells to form xenografts. To gain insights into this chemoresistant model, RNA-seq was performed to elucidate transcriptional alterations between DSRCT cells grown in CSC-like spheres and normal 2-dimensional adherent state. Commonly upregulated and downregulated genes were identified and utilized in pathway analysis revealing upregulation of pathways related to chromatin assembly and disassembly and downregulation of pathways including cell junction assembly and extracellular matrix organization. Alterations in chromatin assembly suggest a role for epigenetics in the DSRCT CSC-like state, which was further investigated with ATAC-seq, identifying over 10,000 differentially accessible peaks, including 4444 sphere accessible peaks and 6,120 adherent accessible peaks. Accessible regions were associated with higher gene expression, including increased accessibility of the CSC marker SOX2 in CSC-like culture conditions. These analyses were further utilized to identify potential CSC therapeutic targets, leading to the identification of B-lymphocyte kinase (BLK) as a CSC-enriched, EWSR1-WT1-regulated, druggable target. BLK inhibition and knockdown reduced CSC-like properties, including abrogation of tumorsphere formation and stemness marker expression. Importantly, BLK knockdown reduced DSRCT CSC-like cell chemoresistance, making its inhibition a promising target for future combination therapy."
lymphoma,FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibition modulates PRC2 and promotes differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia,2024-01-05,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-023-02131-4,"Internal tandem duplication mutations in fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) are recurrent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and increase the risk of relapse. Clinical responses to FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) include myeloid differentiation of the FLT3-ITD clone in nearly half of patients through an unknown mechanism. We identified enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), as a mediator of this effect using a proteomic-based screen. FLT3i downregulated EZH2 protein expression and PRC2 activity on H3K27me3. FLT3-ITD and loss-of-function mutations in EZH2 are mutually exclusive in human AML. We demonstrated that FLT3i increase myeloid maturation with reduced stem/progenitor cell populations in murine Flt3-ITD AML. Combining EZH1/2 inhibitors with FLT3i increased terminal maturation of leukemic cells and reduced leukemic burden. Our data suggest that reduced EZH2 activity following FLT3 inhibition promotes myeloid differentiation of FLT3-ITD leukemic cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for the clinical observations. These results demonstrate that in addition to its known cell survival and proliferation signaling, FLT3-ITD has a second, previously undefined function to maintain a myeloid stem/progenitor cell state through modulation of PRC2 activity. Our findings support exploring EZH1/2 inhibitors as therapy for FLT3-ITD AML."

A recognized association exists between non-chromosomal birth defects and childhood cancer susceptibility.MethodsWe performed whole-exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray analysis in a cohort of childhood cancer (22 individuals, 50% with congenital anomalies) to unravel deleterious germline variants.ResultsA diagnostic yield of 14% was found, encompassing heterozygous variants in bona fide dominant Cancer Predisposition Genes (CPGs). Considering candidate and recessive CPGs harboring monoallelic variants, which were also deemed to play a role in the phenotype, the yield escalated to 45%. Most of the deleterious variants were mapped in genes not conventionally linked to the patient’s tumor type. Relevant findings were detected in 55% of the syndromic individuals, mostly variants potentially underlying both phenotypes.ConclusionWe uncovered a remarkable prevalence of germline deleterious CPG variants, highlighting the significance of a comprehensive genetic analysis in pediatric cancer, especially when coupled with additional clinical signs. Moreover, our findings emphasized the potential for oligogenic inheritance, wherein multiple genes synergistically increase cancer risk. Lastly, our investigation unveiled potentially novel genotype-phenotype associations, such as SETD5 in neuroblastoma, KAT6A in gliomas, JAG1 in hepatoblastomas, and TNFRSF13B in Langerhans cell histiocytosis.Impact

Novel gene-phenotype associations and candidate genes for pediatric cancer were unraveled, such as KAT6A in gliomas, SETD5 in neuroblastoma, JAG1 in hepatoblastomas, and TNFRSF13B in Langerhans cell histiocytosis.


Our analysis revealed a high frequency of deleterious germline variants, particularly in cases accompanied by additional clinical signs, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive genetic evaluation in childhood cancer.


Our findings also underscored the potential for oligogenic inheritance in pediatric cancer risk.

However, whether human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms, which regulate immune response, are associated with BL has not been well investigated, which limits our understanding of BL etiology. Here we investigate this association among 4,645 children aged 0-15 years, 800 with BL, enrolled in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Malawi. HLA alleles are imputed with accuracy >90% for HLA class I and 85-89% for class II alleles. BL risk is elevated with HLA-DQA1*04:01 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-1.97, P = 3.71 × 10−6), with rs2040406(G) in HLA-DQA1 region (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.26-1.63, P = 4.62 × 10−8), and with amino acid Gln at position 53 versus other variants in HLA-DQA1 (OR = 1.36, P = 2.06 × 10−6). The associations with HLA-DQA1*04:01 (OR = 1.29, P = 0.03) and rs2040406(G) (OR = 1.68, P = 0.019) persist in mutually adjusted models. The higher risk rs2040406(G) variant for BL is associated with decreased HLA-DQB1 expression in eQTLs in EBV transformed lymphocytes.

Using conditional genetic inactivation, we show that Ikzf1/Ikaros is essential for normal natural killer (NK) cell lymphopoiesis and IKZF1 directly represses Cish, a negative regulator of interleukin-15 receptor resulting in impaired interleukin-15 receptor signaling. Both Bcl2l11 and BIM levels, and intrinsic apoptosis were increased in Ikzf1-null NK cells, which in part accounts for NK lymphopenia as both were restored to normal levels when Ikzf1 and Bcl2l11 were co-deleted. Ikzf1-null NK cells presented extensive transcriptional alterations with reduced AP-1 transcriptional complex expression and increased expression of Ikzf2/Helios and Ikzf3/Aiolos. IKZF1 and IKZF3 directly bound AP-1 family members and deletion of both Ikzf1 and Ikzf3 in NK cells resulted in further reductions in Jun/Fos expression and complete loss of peripheral NK cells. Collectively, we show that Ikaros family members are important regulators of apoptosis, cytokine responsiveness and AP-1 transcriptional activity."
lymphoma,Identification of therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers in the Siglec family of genes in tumor immune microenvironment of sarcoma,2024-01-05,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50758-1,"Sarcomas (SARC) are a highly heterogeneous cancer type that is prone to recurrence and metastasis. Numerous studies have confirmed that Siglecs are involved in immune signaling and play a key role in regulating immune responses in inflammatory diseases and various cancers. However, studies that systematically explore the therapeutic and prognostic value of Siglecs in SARC patients are very limited. The online databases GEPIA, UALCAN, TIMER, The Kaplan–Meier Plotter, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, and STING were used in this study. IHC staining was performed on the collected patient tissues, and clinical data were statistically analyzed. The transcript levels of most Siglec family members showed a high expression pattern in SARC. Compared with normal tissues, Siglec-5, Siglec-10, and Siglec-12 were abnormally highly expressed in tumor tissues. Importantly, Siglec-15 was significantly associated with poor prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the Siglec family was mainly enriched in hematopoietic cell lineages. The genes associated with molecular mutations in the Siglec family were mainly TP53 and MUC16, among which Siglec-2 and Siglec-15 were significantly associated with the survival of patients. The expression levels of all Siglec family members were significantly correlated with various types of immune cells (B cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells). Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the somatic copy number changes of all Siglec molecules and the abundance of immune infiltrates. Our study paints a promising vision for the development of immunotherapy drugs and the construction of prognostic stratification models by investigating the therapeutic and prognostic potential of the Siglec family for SARC."
lymphoma,Inhibiting anti-angiogenic VEGF165b activates a miR-17-20a-Calcipressin-3 pathway that revascularizes ischemic muscle in peripheral artery disease,2024-01-05,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-023-00431-5,"BackgroundVEGF165a increases the expression of the microRNA-17-92 cluster, promoting developmental, retinal, and tumor angiogenesis. We have previously shown that VEGF165b, an alternatively spliced anti-angiogenic VEGF-A isoform, inhibits the VEGFR-STAT3 pathway in ischemic endothelial cells (ECs) to decrease their angiogenic capacity. In ischemic macrophages (Møs), VEGF165b inhibits VEGFR1 to induce S100A8/A9 expression, which drives M1-like polarization. Our current study aims to determine whether VEGF165b inhibition promotes perfusion recovery by regulating the microRNA(miR)-17-92 cluster in preclinical PAD.MethodsFemoral artery ligation and resection was used as a preclinical PAD model. Hypoxia serum starvation (HSS) was used as an in vitro PAD model. VEGF165b was inhibited/neutralized by an isoform-specific VEGF165b antibody.ResultsHere, we show that VEGF165b-inhibition induces the expression of miR-17-20a (within miR-17-92 (miR-17-18a-19a-19b-20a-92) cluster) in HSS-ECs and HSS-Møs vs. respective normal and/or isotype-matched IgG controls to enhance perfusion recovery. Consistent with the bioinformatics analysis that revealed RCAN3 as a common target of miR-17 and miR-20a, Argonaute-2 pull-down assays showed decreased miR-17-20a expression and higher RCAN3 expression in the RNA-induced silencing complex of HSS-ECs and HSS-Møs vs. respective controls. Inhibiting miR-17-20a induced RCAN3 levels to decrease ischemic angiogenesis and promoted M1-like polarization to impair perfusion recovery. Finally, using STAT3 inhibitors, S100A8/A9 silencers, and VEGFR1-deficient ECs and Møs, we show that VEGF165b-inhibition activates the miR-17-20a-RCAN3 pathway independent of VEGFR1-STAT3 or VEGFR1-S100A8/A9 in ischemic-ECs and ischemic-Møs respectively.ConclusionsOur data revealed a hereunto unrecognized therapeutic ‘miR-17-20a-RCAN3’ pathway in the ischemic vasculature that is VEGFR1-STAT3/S100A8/A9 independent and is activated only upon VEGF165b-inhibition in PAD."
lymphoma,PIWI-interacting RNA-YBX1 inhibits proliferation and metastasis by the MAPK signaling pathway via YBX1 in triple-negative breast cancer,2024-01-05,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-023-01771-w,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women worldwide, with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) having the worst prognosis. Although there are numerous studies on TNBC, there is no effective treatment for it, and it is still a major problem today. Studies on PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are increasing and investigating the mechanism of piRNAs in the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC may lead to new potential treatment targets. Here, we identified a novel piRNA, piR-YBX1, which was downregulated in TNBC compared to matched normal breast tissue. Overexpression of piR-YBX1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion ability of TNBC cells both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, piR-YBX1 could bind directly to mRNA of Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) and overexpression of piR-YBX1 downregulated YBX1 in both mRNA and protein levels, while the function of piR-YBX1 could be partly rescued by overexpression of YBX1. In addition, YBX1 could bind to RAF1 which is the key molecule in the MAPK signaling pathway, and overexpression of piR-YBX1 inhibited the p-MEK and p-ERK1/2, which can be reverted by YBX1. In conclusion, our findings discovered that the piR-YBX1/YBX1/MAPK axis suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC and therefore piR-YBX1 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent for breast cancer."
lymphoma,Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRO represses lung adenocarcinoma progression by inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and restraining tumor metastasis,2024-01-05,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-023-06375-x,"Emerging evidence indicates that protein activities regulated by receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are crucial for a variety of cellular processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and immunological response. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO), an RPTP, has been revealed as a putative suppressor in the development of particular tumors. However, the function and the underlying mechanisms of PTPRO in regulating of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are not well understood. In this view, the present work investigated the role of PTPRO in LUAD. Analysis of 90 pairs of clinical LUAD specimens revealed significantly lower PTPRO levels in LUAD compared with adjacent non-tumor tissue, as well as a negative correlation of PTPRO expression with tumor size and TNM stage. Survival analyses demonstrated that PTPRO level can help stratify the prognosis of LUAD patients. Furthermore, PTPRO overexpression was found to suppress the progression of LUAD both in vitro and in vivo by inducing cell death via mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, downregulating protein expression of molecules (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3, cleaved-caspase 3/9, cleaved-PARP and Bid) essential in cell survival. Additionally, PTPRO decreased LUAD migration and invasion by regulating proteins involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Snail). Moreover, PTPRO was shown to restrain JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. Expression of PTPRO was negatively correlated with p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bcl-2, and Snail levels in LUAD tumor samples. Furthermore, the anti-tumor effect of PTPRO in LUAD was significant but compromised in STAT3-deficient cells. These data support the remarkable suppressive role of PTPRO in LUAD, which may represent a viable therapeutic target for LUAD patients."
lymphoma,Targeting NEDD8 suppresses surgical stress-facilitated metastasis of colon cancer via restraining regulatory T cells,2024-01-05,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-023-06396-6,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a key determinant for the immunosuppressive and premetastatic niche for cancer progression after surgery resection. However, the precise mechanisms regulating Tregs function during surgical stress-facilitated cancer metastasis remain unknown. This study aims to unravel the mechanisms and explore potential strategies for preventing surgical stress-induced metastasis by targeting NEDD8. Using a surgical stress mouse model, we found that surgical stress results in the increased expression of NEDD8 in Tregs. NEDD8 depletion abrogates postoperative lung metastasis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting Treg immunosuppression and thereby partially recovering CD8+T cell and NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, Treg mitophagy and mitochondrial respiration exacerbated in surgically stressed mice were attenuated by NEDD8 depletion. Our observations suggest that cancer progression may result from surgery-induced enhancement of NEDD8 expression and the subsequent immunosuppressive function of Tregs. More importantly, depleting or inhibiting NEDD8 can be an efficient strategy to reduce cancer metastasis after surgery resection by regulating the function of Tregs."
lymphoma,Cellular dynamics following CAR T cell therapy are associated with response and toxicity in relapsed/refractory myeloma,2024-01-06,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-023-02129-y,"B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells revolutionized the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, data on cellular (CAR) T cell dynamics and the association with response, resistance or the occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) are limited. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive flow cytometry analysis of 27 RRMM patients treated with Idecabtagene vicleucel (Ide-cel) to assess the expansion capacity, persistence and effects on bystander cells of BCMA-targeting CAR T cells. Additionally, we addressed side effects, like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and cytopenia. Our results show that in vivo expansion of CD8+ CAR T cells is correlated to response, however persistence is not essential for durable remission in RRMM patients. In addition, our data provide evidence, that an increased fraction of CD8+ T cells at day of leukapheresis in combination with successful lymphodepletion positively influence the outcome. We show that patients at risk for higher-grade CRS can be identified already prior to lymphodepletion. Our extensive characterization contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics and effects of BCMA-targeting CAR T cells, in order to predict the response of individual patients as well as side effects, which can be counteracted at an early stage or even prevented."
lymphoma,ECP versus ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD – a retrospective study by the EBMT transplant complications working party,2024-01-06,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41409-023-02174-2,"Ruxolitinib has become the new standard of care for steroid-refractory and steroid-dependent chronic GVHD (SR-cGVHD). Our aim was to collect comparative data between ruxolitinib and extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP). We asked EBMT centers if they were willing to provide detailed information on GVHD grading, -therapy, -dosing, -response and complications for each included patient. 31 centers responded positively and we included all patients between 1/2017-7/2019 treated with ECP or ruxolitinib for moderate or severe SR-cGVHD. We identified 84 and 57 patients with ECP and ruxolitinib, respectively. We performed multivariate analyses adjusted on grading and type of SR-cGVHD (steroid dependent vs. refractory vs. intolerant to steroids). At day+180 after initiation of treatment for SR-cGVHD the odds ratio in the ruxolitinib group to achieve overall response vs. the ECP group was 1.35 (95% CI = [0.64; 2.91], p = 0.43). In line, we detected no statistically significant differences in overall survival, progression-free survival, non-relapse mortality and relapse incidence. The clinical significance is limited by the retrospective study design and the current data can’t replace prospective studies on ECP in SR-cGVHD. However, the present results contribute to the accumulating evidence on ECP as an effective treatment option in SR-cGVHD."
lymphoma,High-dimensional phenotyping to define the genetic basis of cellular morphology,2024-01-06,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44045-w,"The morphology of cells is dynamic and mediated by genetic and environmental factors. Characterizing how genetic variation impacts cell morphology can provide an important link between disease association and cellular function. Here, we combine genomic sequencing and high-content imaging approaches on iPSCs from 297 unique donors to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and cellular morphology to map what we term cell morphological quantitative trait loci (cmQTLs). We identify novel associations between rare protein altering variants in WASF2, TSPAN15, and PRLR with several morphological traits related to cell shape, nucleic granularity, and mitochondrial distribution. Knockdown of these genes by CRISPRi confirms their role in cell morphology. Analysis of common variants yields one significant association and nominate over 300 variants with suggestive evidence (P < 10−6) of association with one or more morphology traits. We then use these data to make predictions about sample size requirements for increasing discovery in cellular genetic studies. We conclude that, similar to molecular phenotypes, morphological profiling can yield insight about the function of genes and variants."
lymphoma,Immune and stromal transcriptional patterns that influence the outcome of classic Hodgkin lymphoma,2024-01-06,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51376-1,"Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by a rich immune microenvironment as the main tumor component. It involves a broad range of cell populations, which are largely unexplored, even though they are known to be essential for growth and survival of Hodgkin and Reed–Sternberg cells. We profiled the gene expression of 25 FFPE cHL samples using NanoString technology and resolved their microenvironment compositions using cell-deconvolution tools, thereby generating patient-specific signatures. The results confirm individual immune fingerprints and recognize multiple clusters enriched in refractory patients, highlighting the relevance of: (1) the composition of immune cells and their functional status, including myeloid cell populations (M1-like, M2-like, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc.), CD4-positive T cells (exhausted, regulatory, Th17, etc.), cytotoxic CD8 T and natural killer cells; (2) the balance between inflammatory signatures (such as IL6, TNF, IFN-γ/TGF-β) and MHC-I/MHC-II molecules; and (3) several cells, pathways and genes related to the stroma and extracellular matrix remodeling. A validation model combining relevant immune and stromal signatures identifies patients with unfavorable outcomes, producing the same results in an independent cHL series. Our results reveal the heterogeneity of immune responses among patients, confirm previous findings, and identify new functional phenotypes of prognostic and predictive utility."

However, their computational identification and analysis often lag behind major cell types. To fill this gap, we introduce MarsGT: Multi-omics Analysis for Rare population inference using a Single-cell Graph Transformer. It identifies rare cell populations using a probability-based heterogeneous graph transformer on single-cell multi-omics data. MarsGT outperforms existing tools in identifying rare cells across 550 simulated and four real human datasets. In mouse retina data, it reveals unique subpopulations of rare bipolar cells and a Müller glia cell subpopulation. In human lymph node data, MarsGT detects an intermediate B cell population potentially acting as lymphoma precursors. In human melanoma data, it identifies a rare MAIT-like population impacted by a high IFN-I response and reveals the mechanism of immunotherapy. Hence, MarsGT offers biological insights and suggests potential strategies for early detection and therapeutic intervention of disease."

DLBCL-MYC/BCL2-DH/TH are largely germinal centre B-cell like subtype, but show variable clinical outcome, with IG::MYC fusion significantly associated with inferior survival. While DLBCL-MYC/BCL6-DH are variable in their cell-of-origin subtypes and clinical outcome. Intriguingly, only 40-50% of DLBCL with MYC translocation show high MYC protein expression (>70%). We studied 186 DLBCLs with MYC translocation including 32 MYC/BCL2/BCL6-TH, 75 MYC/BCL2-DH and 26 MYC/BCL6-DH. FISH revealed a MYC/BCL6 fusion in 59% of DLBCL-MYC/BCL2/BCL6-TH and 27% of DLBCL-MYC/BCL6-DH. Targeted NGS showed a similar mutation profile and LymphGen genetic subtype between DLBCL-MYC/BCL2/BCL6-TH and DLBCL-MYC/BCL2-DH, but variable LymphGen subtypes among DLBCL-MYC/BCL6-DH. MYC protein expression is uniformly high in DLBCL with IG::MYC, but variable in those with non-IG::MYC including MYC/BCL6-fusion. Translocation breakpoint analyses of 8 cases by TLC-based NGS showed no obvious genomic configuration that enables MYC transactivation in 3 of the 4 cases with non-IG::MYC, while a typical promoter substitution or IGH super enhancer juxtaposition in the remaining cases. The findings potentially explain variable MYC expression in DLBCL with MYC translocation, and also bear practical implications in its routine assessment."

The current study was designed to evaluate the role of exosomal miR-326 in diagnosis and treatment of children with B-ALL. Exosomes were isolated from plasma samples of 30 patients and B-ALL cell lines followed by characterization, using nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoblotting assay and electron microscopy. qPCR showed significantly increased levels of miR-326 in patients exosomes compared with non-cancer controls (P < 0.05, AUC = 0.7500). Moreover, a comparison between the sensitive and drug resistant patients revealed a prognostic value for the exosomal miR326 (P < 0.05, AUC = 0.7755). Co-culture studies on drug resistant patient primary cells and B-ALL cell lines suggested that exosomes with high miR-326 level act as vehicles for reducing cells viability. B-ALL cell line transfection with naked miR-326 mimic confirmed the results, and fluorescence microscopy validated uptake and internalization of exosomes by target cells. The novel introduced features of the exosomal miR-326 address a non-invasive way of diagnosing primary drug resistance in pediatric ALL and advocates a novel therapeutic strategy for this cancer."

The expression of STK36 in PCa and the correlation with clinicopathological characteristics of PCa patients were analyzed using the data from different databases and tissue microarrays. To investigate the role of STK36 on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, STK36 was overexpressed and silenced in DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) was used to test cell proliferation. Cell invasion and migration were detected by cell wound scratch assay and trans well, respectively. The expression profile of STK36, E-Cadherin, and Vimentin was analyzed by Western blot. Cell apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL assay. STK36 expression was upregulated in PCa tissue compared with adjacent benign PCa tissue; it was higher in patients with advanced stages compared with lower stages and was significantly correlated with decreased overall survival. Up-regulation of STK36 significantly promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of DU-145 and PC-3 cells and compensated for the suppression caused by docetaxel treatment in vitro. A striking apoptosis inhibition could be observed when dealing with docetaxel, although the apoptosis of DU-145 and PC-3 cells was not affected by the STK36 exclusive overexpression. Besides, E-Cadherin expression was restrained while the expression levels of vimentin were all enhanced. The knockdown of STK36 reversed the above process. STK36 up-regulation could accelerate the biological behavior and docetaxel resistance of PCa by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activation. STK36 may be potentially used as a target in PCa resolvent with docetaxel."
lymphoma,Structural basis for the activity and specificity of the immune checkpoint inhibitor lirilumab,2024-01-07,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50262-6,"The clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors has underscored the key role of the immune system in controlling cancer. Current FDA-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors target the regulatory receptor pathways of cytotoxic T-cells to enhance their anticancer responses. Despite an abundance of evidence that natural killer (NK) cells can also mediate potent anticancer activities, there are no FDA-approved inhibitors targeting NK cell specific checkpoint pathways. Lirilumab, the most clinically advanced NK cell checkpoint inhibitor, targets inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), however it has yet to conclusively demonstrate clinical efficacy. Here we describe the crystal structure of lirilumab in complex with the inhibitory KIR2DL3, revealing the precise epitope of lirilumab and the molecular mechanisms underlying KIR checkpoint blockade. Notably, the epitope includes several key amino acids that vary across the human population, and binding studies demonstrate the importance of these amino acids for lirilumab binding. These studies reveal how KIR variations in patients could influence the clinical efficacy of lirilumab and reveal general concepts for the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting NK cells."
lymphoma,A cyclin D1 intrinsically disordered domain accesses modified histone motifs to govern gene transcription,2024-01-08,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41389-023-00502-1,"The essential G1-cyclin, CCND1, is frequently overexpressed in cancer, contributing to tumorigenesis by driving cell-cycle progression. D-type cyclins are rate-limiting regulators of G1-S progression in mammalian cells via their ability to bind and activate CDK4 and CDK6. In addition, cyclin D1 conveys kinase-independent transcriptional functions of cyclin D1. Here we report that cyclin D1 associates with H2BS14 via an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD). The same region of cyclin D1 was necessary for the induction of aneuploidy, induction of the DNA damage response, cyclin D1-mediated recruitment into chromatin, and CIN gene transcription. In response to DNA damage H2BS14 phosphorylation occurs, resulting in co-localization with γH2AX in DNA damage foci. Cyclin D1 ChIP seq and γH2AX ChIP seq revealed ~14% overlap. As the cyclin D1 IDD functioned independently of the CDK activity to drive CIN, the IDD domain may provide a rationale new target to complement CDK-extinction strategies."

Condensates can undergo maturation, transitioning from dynamic liquid-like states into solid-like states associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease. Despite their important roles, many aspects of condensate biology remain incompletely understood, requiring tools for acutely manipulating condensate-relevant processes within cells. Here we used the BCL6 BTB domain and its ligands BI-3802 and BI-3812 to create a chemical genetic platform, BTBolig, allowing inducible condensate formation and dissolution. We also developed optogenetic and chemical methods for controlled induction of condensate maturation, where we surprisingly observed recruitment of chaperones into the condensate core and formation of dynamic biphasic condensates. Our work provides insights into the interaction of condensates with proteostasis pathways and introduces a suite of chemical–genetic approaches to probe the role of biomolecular condensates in health and disease."
lymphoma,Neutrophil activation and clonal CAR-T re-expansion underpinning cytokine release syndrome during ciltacabtagene autoleucel therapy in multiple myeloma,2024-01-08,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44648-3,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most common complication of chimeric antigen receptor redirected T cells (CAR-T) therapy. CAR-T toxicity management has been greatly improved, but CRS remains a prime safety concern. Here we follow serum cytokine levels and circulating immune cell transcriptomes longitudinally in 26 relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients receiving the CAR-T product, ciltacabtagene autoleucel, to understand the immunological kinetics of CRS. We find that although T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages are the major overall cytokine source in manifest CRS, neutrophil activation peaks earlier, before the onset of severe symptoms. Intracellularly, signaling activation dominated by JAK/STAT pathway occurred prior to cytokine cascade and displayed regular kinetic changes. CRS severity is accurately described and potentially predicted by temporal cytokine secretion signatures. Notably, CAR-T re-expansion is found in three patients, including a fatal case characterized by somatic TET2-mutation, clonal expanded cytotoxic CAR-T, broadened cytokine profiles and irreversible hepatic toxicity. Together, our findings show that a latent phase with distinct immunological changes precedes manifest CRS, providing an optimal window and potential targets for CRS therapeutic intervention and that CAR-T re-expansion warrants close clinical attention and laboratory investigation to mitigate the lethal risk."
keytruda,Mitigating non-genetic resistance to checkpoint inhibition based on multiple states of immune exhaustion,2024-02-09,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-024-00336-6,"Despite the revolutionary impact of immune checkpoint inhibition on cancer therapy, the lack of response in a subset of patients, as well as the emergence of resistance, remain significant challenges. Here we explore the theoretical consequences of the existence of multiple states of immune cell exhaustion on response to checkpoint inhibition therapy. In particular, we consider the emerging understanding that T cells can exist in various states: fully functioning cytotoxic cells, reversibly exhausted cells with minimal cytotoxicity, and terminally exhausted cells. We hypothesize that inflammation augmented by drug activity triggers transitions between these phenotypes, which can lead to non-genetic resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. We introduce a conceptual mathematical model, coupled with a standard 2-compartment pharmacometric (PK) model, that incorporates these mechanisms. Simulations of the model reveal that, within this framework, the emergence of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors can be mitigated through altering the dose and the frequency of administration. Our analysis also reveals that standard PK metrics do not correlate with treatment outcome. However, we do find that levels of inflammation that we assume trigger the transition from the reversibly to terminally exhausted states play a critical role in therapeutic outcome. A simulation of a population that has different values of this transition threshold reveals that while the standard high-dose, low-frequency dosing strategy can be an effective therapeutic design for some, it is likely to fail a significant fraction of the population. Conversely, a metronomic-like strategy that distributes a fixed amount of drug over many doses given close together is predicted to be effective across the entire simulated population, even at a relatively low cumulative drug dose. We also demonstrate that these predictions hold if the transitions between different states of immune cell exhaustion are triggered by prolonged antigen exposure, an alternative mechanism that has been implicated in this process. Our theoretical analyses demonstrate the potential of mitigating resistance to checkpoint inhibitors via dose modulation."

Converting resistant tumors to immunotherapy sensitive will provide a significant improvement in patient outcome. Here we identify Mi-2β as a key melanoma-intrinsic effector regulating the adaptive anti-tumor immune response. Studies in genetically engineered mouse melanoma models indicate that loss of Mi-2β rescues the immune response to immunotherapy in vivo. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq analysis shows that Mi-2β controls the accessibility of IFN-γ-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mi-2β binds to EZH2 and promotes K510 methylation of EZH2, subsequently activating the trimethylation of H3K27 to inhibit the transcription of ISGs. Finally, we develop an Mi-2β-targeted inhibitor, Z36-MP5, which reduces Mi-2β ATPase activity and reactivates ISG transcription. Consequently, Z36-MP5 induces a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in otherwise resistant melanoma models. Our work provides a potential therapeutic strategy to convert immunotherapy resistant melanomas to sensitive ones."
keytruda,Targeting pro-inflammatory T cells as a novel therapeutic approach to potentially resolve atherosclerosis in humans,2024-03-15,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-024-00945-0,"Atherosclerosis (AS), a leading cause of cardio-cerebrovascular disease worldwide, is driven by the accumulation of lipid contents and chronic inflammation. Traditional strategies primarily focus on lipid reduction to control AS progression, leaving residual inflammatory risks for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). While anti-inflammatory therapies targeting innate immunity have reduced MACEs, many patients continue to face significant risks. Another key component in AS progression is adaptive immunity, but its potential role in preventing AS remains unclear. To investigate this, we conducted a retrospective cohort study on tumor patients with AS plaques. We found that anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly reduces AS plaque size. With multi-omics single-cell analyses, we comprehensively characterized AS plaque-specific PD-1+ T cells, which are activated and pro-inflammatory. We demonstrated that anti-PD-1 mAb, when captured by myeloid-expressed Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs), interacts with PD-1 expressed on T cells. This interaction turns the anti-PD-1 mAb into a substitute PD-1 ligand, suppressing T-cell functions in the PD-1 ligands-deficient context of AS plaques. Further, we conducted a prospective cohort study on tumor patients treated with anti-PD-1 mAb with or without Fc-binding capability. Our analysis shows that anti-PD-1 mAb with Fc-binding capability effectively reduces AS plaque size, while anti-PD-1 mAb without Fc-binding capability does not. Our work suggests that T cell-targeting immunotherapy can be an effective strategy to resolve AS in humans."
