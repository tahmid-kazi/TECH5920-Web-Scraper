Nav1.7 as a chondrocyte regulator and therapeutic target for osteoarthritis,"Wenyu Fu, Dmytro Vasylyev, Yufei Bi, Mingshuang Zhang, Guodong Sun, Asya Khleborodova, Guiwu Huang, Libo Zhao, Renpeng Zhou, Yonggang Li, Shujun Liu, Xianyi Cai, Wenjun He, Min Cui, Xiangli Zhao, Aubryanna Hettinghouse, Julia Good, Ellen Kim, Eric Strauss, Philipp Leucht, Ran Schwarzkopf, Edward X. Guo, Jonathan Samuels, Wenhuo Hu, Mukundan Attur, Stephen G. Waxman, Chuan-ju Liu",2024-01-03,,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease. Currently there are no effective methods that simultaneously prevent joint degeneration and reduce pain1. Although limited evidence suggests the existence of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in chondrocytes2, their expression and function in chondrocytes and in OA remain essentially unknown. Here we identify Nav1.7 as an OA-associated VGSC and demonstrate that human OA chondrocytes express functional Nav1.7 channels, with a density of 0.1 to 0.15 channels per µm2 and 350 to 525 channels per cell. Serial genetic ablation of Nav1.7 in multiple mouse models demonstrates that Nav1.7 expressed in dorsal root ganglia neurons is involved in pain, whereas Nav1.7 in chondrocytes regulates OA progression. Pharmacological blockade of Nav1.7 with selective or clinically used pan-Nav channel blockers significantly ameliorates the progression of structural joint damage, and reduces OA pain behaviour. Mechanistically, Nav1.7 blockers regulate intracellular Ca2+ signalling and the chondrocyte secretome, which in turn affects chondrocyte biology and OA progression. Identification of Nav1.7 as a novel chondrocyte-expressed, OA-associated channel uncovers a dual target for the development of disease-modifying and non-opioid pain relief treatment for OA."
MRE11 liberates cGAS from nucleosome sequestration during tumorigenesis,"Min-Guk Cho, Rashmi J. Kumar, Chien-Chu Lin, Joshua A. Boyer, Jamshaid A. Shahir, Katerina Fagan-Solis, Dennis A. Simpson, Cheng Fan, Christine E. Foster, Anna M. Goddard, Lynn M. Lerner, Simon W. Ellington, Qinhong Wang, Ying Wang, Alice Y. Ho, Pengda Liu, Charles M. Perou, Qi Zhang, Robert K. McGinty, Jeremy E. Purvis, Gaorav P. Gupta",2024-01-10,,"Oncogene-induced replication stress generates endogenous DNA damage that activates cGAS–STING-mediated signalling and tumour suppression1,2,3. However, the precise mechanism of cGAS activation by endogenous DNA damage remains enigmatic, particularly given that high-affinity histone acidic patch (AP) binding constitutively inhibits cGAS by sterically hindering its activation by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we report that the DNA double-strand break sensor MRE11 suppresses mammary tumorigenesis through a pivotal role in regulating cGAS activation. We demonstrate that binding of the MRE11–RAD50–NBN complex to nucleosome fragments is necessary to displace cGAS from acidic-patch-mediated sequestration, which enables its mobilization and activation by dsDNA. MRE11 is therefore essential for cGAS activation in response to oncogenic stress, cytosolic dsDNA and ionizing radiation. Furthermore, MRE11-dependent cGAS activation promotes ZBP1–RIPK3–MLKL-mediated necroptosis, which is essential to suppress oncogenic proliferation and breast tumorigenesis. Notably, downregulation of ZBP1 in human triple-negative breast cancer is associated with increased genome instability, immune suppression and poor patient prognosis. These findings establish MRE11 as a crucial mediator that links DNA damage and cGAS activation, resulting in tumour suppression through ZBP1-dependent necroptosis."
Deciphering cell states and genealogies of human haematopoiesis,"Chen Weng, Fulong Yu, Dian Yang, Michael Poeschla, L. Alexander Liggett, Matthew G.

Sankaran",2024-01-22,,"The human blood system is maintained through the differentiation and massive amplification of a limited number of long-lived haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1. Perturbations to this process underlie diverse diseases, but the clonal contributions to human haematopoiesis and how this changes with age remain incompletely understood. Although recent insights have emerged from barcoding studies in model systems2,3,4,5, simultaneous detection of cell states and phylogenies from natural barcodes in humans remains challenging. Here we introduce an improved, single-cell lineage-tracing system based on deep detection of naturally occurring mitochondrial DNA mutations with simultaneous readout of transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility. We use this system to define the clonal architecture of HSCs and map the physiological state and output of clones. We uncover functional heterogeneity in HSC clones, which is stable over months and manifests as both differences in total HSC output and biases towards the production of different mature cell types. We also find that the diversity of HSC clones decreases markedly with age, leading to an oligoclonal structure with multiple distinct clonal expansions. Our study thus provides a clonally resolved and cell-state-aware atlas of human haematopoiesis at single-cell resolution, showing an unappreciated functional diversity of human HSC clones and, more broadly, paving the way for refined studies of clonal dynamics across a range of tissues in human health and disease."
An epigenetic barrier sets the timing of human neuronal maturation,"Gabriele Ciceri, Arianna Baggiolini, Hyein S. Cho, Meghana Kshirsagar, Silvia Benito-Kwiecinski, Ryan M. Walsh, Kelly A. Aromolaran, Alberto J. Gonzalez-Hernandez, Hermany Munguba, So Yeon Koo, Nan Xu, Kaylin J. Sevilla, Peter A. Goldstein, Joshua Levitz, Christina S. Leslie, Richard P. Koche, Lorenz Studer",2024-01-31,,"The pace of human brain development is highly protracted compared with most other species1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The maturation of cortical neurons is particularly slow, taking months to years to develop adult functions3,4,5. Remarkably, such protracted timing is retained in cortical neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) during in vitro differentiation or upon transplantation into the mouse brain4,8,9. Those findings suggest the presence of a cell-intrinsic clock setting the pace of neuronal maturation, although the molecular nature of this clock remains unknown. Here we identify an epigenetic developmental programme that sets the timing of human neuronal maturation. First, we developed a hPSC-based approach to synchronize the birth of cortical neurons in vitro which enabled us to define an atlas of morphological, functional and molecular maturation. We observed a slow unfolding of maturation programmes, limited by the retention of specific epigenetic factors. Loss of function of several of those factors in cortical neurons enables precocious maturation. Transient inhibition of EZH2, EHMT1 and EHMT2 or DOT1L, at progenitor stage primes newly born neurons to rapidly acquire mature properties upon differentiation. Thus our findings reveal that the rate at which human neurons mature is set well before neurogenesis through the establishment of an epigenetic barrier in progenitor cells. Mechanistically, this barrier holds transcriptional maturation programmes in a poised state that is gradually released to ensure the prolonged timeline of human cortical neuron maturation."
Naturally occurring T cell mutations enhance engineered T cell therapies,"Julie Garcia, Jay Daniels, Yujin Lee, Iowis Zhu, Kathleen Cheng, Qing Liu, Daniel Goodman, Cassandra Burnett, Calvin Law, Chloë Thienpont, Josef Alavi, Camillia Azimi, Garrett Montgomery, Kole T. Roybal, Jaehyuk Choi",2024-02-07,,"Adoptive T cell therapies have produced exceptional responses in a subset of patients with cancer. However, therapeutic efficacy can be hindered by poor T cell persistence and function1. In human T cell cancers, evolution of the disease positively selects for mutations that improve fitness of T cells in challenging situations analogous to those faced by therapeutic T cells. Therefore, we reasoned that these mutations could be co-opted to improve T cell therapies. Here we systematically screened the effects of 71 mutations from T cell neoplasms on T cell signalling, cytokine production and in vivo persistence in tumours. We identify a gene fusion, CARD11–PIK3R3, found in a CD4+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma2, that augments CARD11–BCL10–MALT1 complex signalling and anti-tumour efficacy of therapeutic T cells in several immunotherapy-refractory models in an antigen-dependent manner. Underscoring its potential to be deployed safely, CARD11–PIK3R3-expressing cells were followed up to 418 days after T cell transfer in vivo without evidence of malignant transformation. Collectively, our results indicate that exploiting naturally occurring mutations represents a promising approach to explore the extremes of T cell biology and discover how solutions derived from evolution of malignant T cells can improve a broad range of T cell therapies."
The nuclear factor ID3 endows macrophages with a potent anti-tumour activity,"Zihou Deng, Pierre-Louis Loyher, Tomi Lazarov, Li Li, Zeyang Shen, Bhavneet Bhinder, Hairu Yang, Yi Zhong, Araitz Alberdi, Joan Massague, Joseph C. Sun, Robert Benezra, Christopher K. Glass, Olivier Elemento, Christine A. Iacobuzio-Donahue, Frederic Geissmann",2024-02-07,,"Macrophage activation is controlled by a balance between activating and inhibitory receptors1,2,3,4,5,6,7, which protect normal tissues from excessive damage during infection8,9 but promote tumour growth and metastasis in cancer7,10. Here we report that the Kupffer cell lineage-determining factor ID3 controls this balance and selectively endows Kupffer cells with the ability to phagocytose live tumour cells and orchestrate the recruitment, proliferation and activation of natural killer and CD8 T lymphoid effector cells in the liver to restrict the growth of a variety of tumours. ID3 shifts the macrophage inhibitory/activating receptor balance to promote the phagocytic and lymphoid response, at least in part by buffering the binding of the transcription factors ELK1 and E2A at the SIRPA locus. Furthermore, loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that ID3 is sufficient to confer this potent anti-tumour activity to mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived macrophages. Expression of ID3 is therefore necessary and sufficient to endow macrophages with the ability to form an efficient anti-tumour niche, which could be harnessed for cell therapy in cancer."
Bone marrow plasma cells require P2RX4 to sense extracellular ATP,"Masaki Ishikawa, Zainul S. Hasanali, Yongge Zhao, Arundhoti Das, Marieke Lavaert, Carly J. Roman, Jennifer Londregan, David Allman, Avinash Bhandoola",2024-02-14,,"Plasma cells produce large quantities of antibodies and so play essential roles in immune protection1. Plasma cells, including a long-lived subset, reside in the bone marrow where they depend on poorly defined microenvironment-linked survival signals1. We show that bone marrow plasma cells use the ligand-gated purinergic ion channel P2RX4 to sense extracellular ATP released by bone marrow osteoblasts through the gap-junction protein pannexin 3 (PANX3). Mutation of Panx3 or P2rx4 each caused decreased serum antibodies and selective loss of bone marrow plasma cells. Compared to their wild-type counterparts, PANX3-null osteoblasts secreted less extracellular ATP and failed to support plasma cells in vitro. The P2RX4-specific inhibitor 5-BDBD abrogated the impact of extracellular ATP on bone marrow plasma cells in vitro, depleted bone marrow plasma cells in vivo and reduced pre-induced antigen-specific serum antibody titre with little posttreatment rebound. P2RX4 blockade also reduced autoantibody titre and kidney disease in two mouse models of humoral autoimmunity. P2RX4 promotes plasma cell survival by regulating endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, as short-term P2RX4 blockade caused accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated regulatory proteins including ATF4 and B-lineage mutation of the pro-apoptotic ATF4 target Chop prevented bone marrow plasma cell demise on P2RX4 inhibition. Thus, generating mature protective and pathogenic plasma cells requires P2RX4 signalling controlled by PANX3-regulated extracellular ATP release from bone marrow niche cells."
Deep whole-genome analysis of 494 hepatocellular carcinomas,"Lei Chen, Chong Zhang, Ruidong Xue, Mo Liu, Jian Bai, Jinxia Bao, Yin Wang, Nanhai Jiang, Zhixuan Li, Wenwen Wang, Ruiru Wang, Bo Zheng, Airong Yang, Ji Hu, Ke Liu, Siyun Shen, Yangqianwen Zhang, Mixue Bai, Yan Wang, Yanjing Zhu, Shuai Yang, Qiang Gao, Jin Gu, Dong Gao, Xin Wei Wang, Hidewaki Nakagawa, Ning Zhang, Lin Wu, Steven G. Rozen, Fan Bai, Hongyang Wang",2024-02-14,,"Over half of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases diagnosed worldwide are in China1,2,3. However, whole-genome analysis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC in Chinese individuals is limited4,5,6,7,8, with current analyses of HCC mainly from non-HBV-enriched populations9,10. Here we initiated the Chinese Liver Cancer Atlas (CLCA) project and performed deep whole-genome sequencing (average depth, 120×) of 494 HCC tumours. We identified 6 coding and 28 non-coding previously undescribed driver candidates. Five previously undescribed mutational signatures were found, including aristolochic-acid-associated indel and doublet base signatures, and a single-base-substitution signature that we termed SBS_H8. Pentanucleotide context analysis and experimental validation confirmed that SBS_H8 was distinct to the aristolochic-acid-associated SBS22. Notably, HBV integrations could take the form of extrachromosomal circular DNA, resulting in elevated copy numbers and gene expression. Our high-depth data also enabled us to characterize subclonal clustered alterations, including chromothripsis, chromoplexy and kataegis, suggesting that these catastrophic events could also occur in late stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. Pathway analysis of all classes of alterations further linked non-coding mutations to dysregulation of liver metabolism. Finally, we performed in vitro and in vivo assays to show that fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), determined as both a candidate coding and non-coding driver, regulates HCC progression and metastasis. Our CLCA study depicts a detailed genomic landscape and evolutionary history of HCC in Chinese individuals, providing important clinical implications."

Although MN are a hallmark of ageing and diseases associated with genomic instability, the catalogue of genetic players that regulate the generation of MN remains to be determined. Here we analyse 997 mouse mutant lines, revealing 145 genes whose loss significantly increases (n = 71) or decreases (n = 74) MN formation, including many genes whose orthologues are linked to human disease. We found that mice null for Dscc1, which showed the most significant increase in MN, also displayed a range of phenotypes characteristic of patients with cohesinopathy disorders. After validating the DSCC1-associated MN instability phenotype in human cells, we used genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening to define synthetic lethal and synthetic rescue interactors. We found that the loss of SIRT1 can rescue phenotypes associated with DSCC1 loss in a manner paralleling restoration of protein acetylation of SMC3. Our study reveals factors involved in maintaining genomic stability and shows how this information can be used to identify mechanisms that are relevant to human disease biology1."
Nuclear export of circular RNA,"Linh H. Ngo, Andrew G. Bert, B. Kate Dredge, Tobias Williams, Vincent Murphy, Wanqiu Li, William B. Hamilton, Kirstyn T. Carey, John Toubia, Katherine A. Pillman, Dawei Liu, Jessica Desogus, Jeffrey A. Chao, Andrew J. Deans, Gregory J. Goodall, Vihandha O. Wickramasinghe",2024-02-14,,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are increasingly being implicated in a variety of functions in normal and cancerous cells1,2,3,4,5, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus6,7,8,9,10. circRNAs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here we identify a pathway that is specific for the nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. Enhancing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient by depletion or chemical inhibition of the major protein exporter CRM1 selectively increases the nuclear export of circRNAs, while reducing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient selectively blocks circRNA export. Depletion or knockout of exportin-2 specifically inhibits nuclear export of circRNA. Analysis of nuclear circRNA-binding proteins reveals that interaction between IGF2BP1 and circRNA is enhanced by Ran-GTP. The formation of circRNA export complexes in the nucleus is promoted by Ran-GTP through its interactions with exportin-2, circRNA and IGF2BP1. Our findings demonstrate that adaptors such as IGF2BP1 that bind directly to circular RNAs recruit Ran-GTP and exportin-2 to export circRNAs in a mechanism that is analogous to protein export, rather than mRNA export."
B cells orchestrate tolerance to the neuromyelitis optica autoantigen AQP4,"Ali Maisam Afzali, Lucy Nirschl, Christopher Sie, Monika Pfaller, Oleksii Ulianov, Tobias Hassler, Christine Federle, Elisabetta Petrozziello, Sudhakar Reddy Kalluri, Hsin Hsiang Chen, Sofia Tyystjärvi, Andreas Muschaweckh, Katja Lammens, Claire Delbridge, Andreas Büttner, Katja Steiger, Gönül Seyhan, Ole Petter Ottersen, Rupert Öllinger, Roland Rad, Sebastian Jarosch, Adrian Straub, Anton Mühlbauer, Simon Grassmann, Bernhard Hemmer, Jan P.

Busch, Ludger Klein, Thomas Korn",2024-02-21,,"Neuromyelitis optica is a paradigmatic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, in which the water-channel protein AQP4 is the target antigen1. The immunopathology in neuromyelitis optica is largely driven by autoantibodies to AQP42. However, the T cell response that is required for the generation of these anti-AQP4 antibodies is not well understood. Here we show that B cells endogenously express AQP4 in response to activation with anti-CD40 and IL-21 and are able to present their endogenous AQP4 to T cells with an AQP4-specific T cell receptor (TCR). A population of thymic B cells emulates a CD40-stimulated B cell transcriptome, including AQP4 (in mice and humans), and efficiently purges the thymic TCR repertoire of AQP4-reactive clones. Genetic ablation of Aqp4 in B cells rescues AQP4-specific TCRs despite sufficient expression of AQP4 in medullary thymic epithelial cells, and B-cell-conditional AQP4-deficient mice are fully competent to raise AQP4-specific antibodies in productive germinal-centre responses. Thus, the negative selection of AQP4-specific thymocytes is dependent on the expression and presentation of AQP4 by thymic B cells. As AQP4 is expressed in B cells in a CD40-dependent (but not AIRE-dependent) manner, we propose that thymic B cells might tolerize against a group of germinal-centre-associated antigens, including disease-relevant autoantigens such as AQP4."
Mechanisms of action and resistance in histone methylation-targeted therapy,"Makoto Yamagishi, Yuta Kuze, Seiichiro Kobayashi, Makoto Nakashima, Satoko Morishima, Toyotaka Kawamata, Junya Makiyama, Kako Suzuki, Masahide Seki, Kazumi Abe, Kiyomi Imamura, Eri Watanabe, Kazumi Tsuchiya, Isao Yasumatsu, Gensuke Takayama, Yoshiyuki Hizukuri, Kazumi Ito, Yukihiro Taira, Yasuhito Nannya, Arinobu Tojo, Toshiki Watanabe, Shinji Tsutsumi, Yutaka Suzuki, Kaoru Uchimaru",2024-02-21,,"Epigenomes enable the rectification of disordered cancer gene expression, thereby providing new targets for pharmacological interventions. The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated1,2,3,4,5,6,7. However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1–EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2–compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations, TET2 mutation or elevated DNMT3A expression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies."
WNT signalling control by KDM5C during development affects cognition,"Violetta Karwacki-Neisius, Ahram Jang, Engin Cukuroglu, Albert Tai, Alan Jiao, Danilo Predes, Joon Yoon, Emily Brookes, Jiekai Chen, Aimee Iberg, Florian Halbritter, Katrin Õunap, Jozef Gecz, Thorsten M. Schlaeger, Shannan Ho Sui, Jonathan Göke, Xi He, Maria K. Lehtinen, Scott L. Pomeroy, Yang Shi",2024-02-21,,"Although KDM5C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in X-linked intellectual disability1, the exact mechanisms that lead to cognitive impairment remain unknown. Here we use human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and Kdm5c knockout mice to conduct cellular, transcriptomic, chromatin and behavioural studies. KDM5C is identified as a safeguard to ensure that neurodevelopment occurs at an appropriate timescale, the disruption of which leads to intellectual disability. Specifically, there is a developmental window during which KDM5C directly controls WNT output to regulate the timely transition of primary to intermediate progenitor cells and consequently neurogenesis. Treatment with WNT signalling modulators at specific times reveal that only a transient alteration of the canonical WNT signalling pathway is sufficient to rescue the transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes in patient-derived cells and to induce these changes in wild-type cells. Notably, WNT inhibition during this developmental period also rescues behavioural changes of Kdm5c knockout mice. Conversely, a single injection of WNT3A into the brains of wild-type embryonic mice cause anxiety and memory alterations. Our work identifies KDM5C as a crucial sentinel for neurodevelopment and sheds new light on KDM5C mutation-associated intellectual disability. The results also increase our general understanding of memory and anxiety formation, with the identification of WNT functioning in a transient nature to affect long-lasting cognitive function."

Here we studied 246,102 single epithelial cells from 16 early-stage LUADs and 47 matched normal lung samples. Epithelial cells comprised diverse normal and cancer cell states, and diversity among cancer cells was strongly linked to LUAD-specific oncogenic drivers. KRAS mutant cancer cells showed distinct transcriptional features, reduced differentiation and low levels of aneuploidy. Non-malignant areas surrounding human LUAD samples were enriched with alveolar intermediate cells that displayed elevated KRT8 expression (termed KRT8+ alveolar intermediate cells (KACs) here), reduced differentiation, increased plasticity and driver KRAS mutations. Expression profiles of KACs were enriched in lung precancer cells and in LUAD cells and signified poor survival. In mice exposed to tobacco carcinogen, KACs emerged before lung tumours and persisted for months after cessation of carcinogen exposure. Moreover, they acquired Kras mutations and conveyed sensitivity to targeted KRAS inhibition in KAC-enriched organoids derived from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Last, lineage-labelling of AT2 cells or KRT8+ cells following carcinogen exposure showed that KACs are possible intermediates in AT2-to-tumour cell transformation. This study provides new insights into epithelial cell states at the root of LUAD development, and such states could harbour potential targets for prevention or intervention."

However, there remains little consensus on the mechanism(s) of response with this combination2. Here we find that a high baseline of intratumoural macrophages and regulatory T cells is associated with better outcomes in patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab but not with atezolizumab alone. Serum sample analysis revealed that macrophage activation is associated with a clinical benefit in patients who received the combination treatment. In mouse tumour models, tiragolumab surrogate antibodies inflamed tumour-associated macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells through Fcγ receptors (FcγR), in turn driving anti-tumour CD8+ T cells from an exhausted effector-like state to a more memory-like state. These results reveal a mechanism of action through which TIGIT checkpoint inhibitors can remodel immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments, and suggest that FcγR engagement is an important consideration in anti-TIGIT antibody development."

Here we report the design, implementation and application of reinforcement learning bandit optimization models7,8,9,10 to identify generally applicable conditions by efficient condition sampling and evaluation of experimental feedback. Performance benchmarking on existing datasets statistically showed high accuracies for identifying general conditions, with up to 31% improvement over baselines that mimic state-of-the-art optimization approaches. A palladium-catalysed imidazole C–H arylation reaction, an aniline amide coupling reaction and a phenol alkylation reaction were investigated experimentally to evaluate use cases and functionalities of the bandit optimization model in practice. In all three cases, the reaction conditions that were most generally applicable yet not well studied for the respective reaction were identified after surveying less than 15% of the expert-designed reaction space."
SOX17 enables immune evasion of early colorectal adenomas and cancers,"Norihiro Goto, Peter M. K. Westcott, Saori Goto, Shinya Imada, Martin S. Taylor, George Eng, Jonathan Braverman, Vikram Deshpande, Tyler Jacks, Judith Agudo, Ömer H. Yilmaz",2024-02-28,,"A hallmark of cancer is the avoidance of immune destruction. This process has been primarily investigated in locally advanced or metastatic cancer1,2,3; however, much less is known about how pre-malignant or early invasive tumours evade immune detection. Here, to understand this process in early colorectal cancers (CRCs), we investigated how naive colon cancer organoids that were engineered in vitro to harbour Apc-null, KrasG12D and Trp53-null (AKP) mutations adapted to the in vivo native colonic environment. Comprehensive transcriptomic and chromatin analyses revealed that the endoderm-specifying transcription factor SOX17 became strongly upregulated in vivo. Notably, whereas SOX17 loss did not affect AKP organoid propagation in vitro, its loss markedly reduced the ability of AKP tumours to persist in vivo. The small fraction of SOX17-null tumours that grew displayed notable interferon-γ (IFNγ)-producing effector-like CD8+ T cell infiltrates in contrast to the immune-suppressive microenvironment in wild-type counterparts. Mechanistically, in both endogenous Apc-null pre-malignant adenomas and transplanted organoid-derived AKP CRCs, SOX17 suppresses the ability of tumour cells to sense and respond to IFNγ, preventing anti-tumour T cell responses. Finally, SOX17 engages a fetal intestinal programme that drives differentiation away from LGR5+ tumour cells to produce immune-evasive LGR5− tumour cells with lower expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I). We propose that SOX17 is a transcription factor that is engaged during the early steps of colon cancer to orchestrate an immune-evasive programme that permits CRC initiation and progression."

Victora",2024-03-06,,"Immune cells rely on transient physical interactions with other immune and non-immune populations to regulate their function1. To study these ‘kiss-and-run’ interactions directly in vivo, we previously developed LIPSTIC (labelling immune partnerships by SorTagging intercellular contacts)2, an approach that uses enzymatic transfer of a labelled substrate between the molecular partners CD40L and CD40 to label interacting cells. Reliance on this pathway limited the use of LIPSTIC to measuring interactions between CD4+ T helper cells and antigen-presenting cells, however. Here we report the development of a universal version of LIPSTIC (uLIPSTIC), which can record physical interactions both among immune cells and between immune and non-immune populations irrespective of the receptors and ligands involved. We show that uLIPSTIC can be used, among other things, to monitor the priming of CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells, reveal the steady-state cellular partners of regulatory T cells and identify germinal centre-resident T follicular helper cells on the basis of their ability to interact cognately with germinal centre B cells. By coupling uLIPSTIC with single-cell transcriptomics, we build a catalogue of the immune populations that physically interact with intestinal epithelial cells at the steady state and profile the evolution of the interactome of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8+ T cells in multiple organs following systemic infection. Thus, uLIPSTIC provides a broadly useful technology for measuring and understanding cell–cell interactions across multiple biological systems."

Thomas",2024-03-13,,"The evolutionary processes that underlie the marked sensitivity of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to chemotherapy and rapid relapse are unknown1,2,3. Here we determined tumour phylogenies at diagnosis and throughout chemotherapy and immunotherapy by multiregion sequencing of 160 tumours from 65 patients. Treatment-naive SCLC exhibited clonal homogeneity at distinct tumour sites, whereas first-line platinum-based chemotherapy led to a burst in genomic intratumour heterogeneity and spatial clonal diversity. We observed branched evolution and a shift to ancestral clones underlying tumour relapse. Effective radio- or immunotherapy induced a re-expansion of founder clones with acquired genomic damage from first-line chemotherapy. Whereas TP53 and RB1 alterations were exclusively part of the common ancestor, MYC family amplifications were frequently not constituents of the founder clone. At relapse, emerging subclonal mutations affected key genes associated with SCLC biology, and tumours harbouring clonal CREBBP/EP300 alterations underwent genome duplications. Gene-damaging TP53 alterations and co-alterations of TP53 missense mutations with TP73, CREBBP/EP300 or FMN2 were significantly associated with shorter disease relapse following chemotherapy. In summary, we uncover key processes of the genomic evolution of SCLC under therapy, identify the common ancestor as the source of clonal diversity at relapse and show central genomic patterns associated with sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy."

Johnston",2024-03-20,,"Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a bacterium present in the human oral cavity and rarely found in the lower gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals1, is enriched in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tumours2,3,4,5. High intratumoural Fn loads are associated with recurrence, metastases and poorer patient prognosis5,6,7,8. Here, to delineate Fn genetic factors facilitating tumour colonization, we generated closed genomes for 135 Fn strains; 80 oral strains from individuals without cancer and 55 unique cancer strains cultured from tumours from 51 patients with CRC. Pangenomic analyses identified 483 CRC-enriched genetic factors. Tumour-isolated strains predominantly belong to Fn subspecies animalis (Fna). However, genomic analyses reveal that Fna, considered a single subspecies, is instead composed of two distinct clades (Fna C1 and Fna C2). Of these, only Fna C2 dominates the CRC tumour niche. Inter-Fna analyses identified 195 Fna C2-associated genetic factors consistent with increased metabolic potential and colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. In support of this, Fna C2-treated mice had an increased number of intestinal adenomas and altered metabolites. Microbiome analysis of human tumour tissue from 116 patients with CRC demonstrated Fna C2 enrichment. Comparison of 62 paired specimens showed that only Fna C2 is tumour enriched compared to normal adjacent tissue. This was further supported by metagenomic analysis of stool samples from 627 patients with CRC and 619 healthy individuals. Collectively, our results identify the Fna clade bifurcation, show that specifically Fna C2 drives the reported Fn enrichment in human CRC and reveal the genetic underpinnings of pathoadaptation of Fna C2 to the CRC niche."

The outer layer of the meninges, the dura mater, has recently been described to contain both innate and adaptive immune cells, and functions as a site for B cell development3,4,5,6. Here we identify organized lymphoid structures that protect fenestrated vasculature in the dura mater. The most elaborate of these dural-associated lymphoid tissues (DALT) surrounded the rostral-rhinal confluence of the sinuses and included lymphatic vessels. We termed this structure, which interfaces with the skull bone marrow and a comparable venous plexus at the skull base, the rostral-rhinal venolymphatic hub. Immune aggregates were present in DALT during homeostasis and expanded with age or after challenge with systemic or nasal antigens. DALT contain germinal centre B cells and support the generation of somatically mutated, antibody-producing cells in response to a nasal pathogen challenge. Inhibition of lymphocyte entry into the rostral-rhinal hub at the time of nasal viral challenge abrogated the generation of germinal centre B cells and class-switched plasma cells, as did perturbation of B–T cell interactions. These data demonstrate a lymphoid structure around vasculature in the dura mater that can sample antigens and rapidly support humoral immune responses after local pathogen challenge."
Depleting myeloid-biased haematopoietic stem cells rejuvenates aged immunity,"Jason B. Ross, Lara M. Myers, Joseph J. Noh, Madison M. Collins, Aaron B. Carmody, Ronald J. Messer, Erica Dhuey, Kim J. Hasenkrug, Irving L. Weissman",2024-03-27,,"Ageing of the immune system is characterized by decreased lymphopoiesis and adaptive immunity, and increased inflammation and myeloid pathologies1,2. Age-related changes in populations of self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to underlie these phenomena3. During youth, HSCs with balanced output of lymphoid and myeloid cells (bal-HSCs) predominate over HSCs with myeloid-biased output (my-HSCs), thereby promoting the lymphopoiesis required for initiating adaptive immune responses, while limiting the production of myeloid cells, which can be pro-inflammatory4. Ageing is associated with increased proportions of my-HSCs, resulting in decreased lymphopoiesis and increased myelopoiesis3,5,6. Transfer of bal-HSCs results in abundant lymphoid and myeloid cells, a stable phenotype that is retained after secondary transfer; my-HSCs also retain their patterns of production after secondary transfer5. The origin and potential interconversion of these two subsets is still unclear. If they are separate subsets postnatally, it might be possible to reverse the ageing phenotype by eliminating my-HSCs in aged mice. Here we demonstrate that antibody-mediated depletion of my-HSCs in aged mice restores characteristic features of a more youthful immune system, including increasing common lymphocyte progenitors, naive T cells and B cells, while decreasing age-related markers of immune decline. Depletion of my-HSCs in aged mice improves primary and secondary adaptive immune responses to viral infection. These findings may have relevance to the understanding and intervention of diseases exacerbated or caused by dominance of the haematopoietic system by my-HSCs."

Adults with T cell leukaemias and lymphomas, collectively called T cell cancers, have short survival10,11 and lack such targeted therapies. Thus, T cell cancers particularly warrant the development of CAR T cells and antibodies to improve patient outcomes. Preclinical studies showed that targeting T cell receptor β-chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) can kill cancerous T cells while preserving sufficient healthy T cells to maintain immunity12, making TRBC1 an attractive target to treat T cell cancers. However, the first-in-human clinical trial of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells reported a low response rate and unexplained loss of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells13,14. Here we demonstrate that CAR T cells are lost due to killing by the patient’s normal T cells, reducing their efficacy. To circumvent this issue, we developed an antibody–drug conjugate that could kill TRBC1+ cancer cells in vitro and cure human T cell cancers in mouse models. The anti-TRBC1 antibody–drug conjugate may provide an optimal format for TRBC1 targeting and produce superior responses in patients with T cell cancers."

M. Roberts",2024-03-27,,"Whereas oncogenes can potentially be inhibited with small molecules, the loss of tumour suppressors is more common and is problematic because the tumour-suppressor proteins are no longer present to be targeted. Notable examples include SMARCB1-mutant cancers, which are highly lethal malignancies driven by the inactivation of a subunit of SWI/SNF (also known as BAF) chromatin-remodelling complexes. Here, to generate mechanistic insights into the consequences of SMARCB1 mutation and to identify vulnerabilities, we contributed 14 SMARCB1-mutant cell lines to a near genome-wide CRISPR screen as part of the Cancer Dependency Map Project1,2,3. We report that the little-studied gene DDB1–CUL4-associated factor 5 (DCAF5) is required for the survival of SMARCB1-mutant cancers. We show that DCAF5 has a quality-control function for SWI/SNF complexes and promotes the degradation of incompletely assembled SWI/SNF complexes in the absence of SMARCB1. After depletion of DCAF5, SMARCB1-deficient SWI/SNF complexes reaccumulate, bind to target loci and restore SWI/SNF-mediated gene expression to levels that are sufficient to reverse the cancer state, including in vivo. Consequently, cancer results not from the loss of SMARCB1 function per se, but rather from DCAF5-mediated degradation of SWI/SNF complexes. These data indicate that therapeutic targeting of ubiquitin-mediated quality-control factors may effectively reverse the malignant state of some cancers driven by disruption of tumour suppressor complexes."

Parsons, Britt Adamson",2024-04-03,,"Prime editing enables the precise modification of genomes through reverse transcription of template sequences appended to the 3′ ends of CRISPR–Cas guide RNAs1. To identify cellular determinants of prime editing, we developed scalable prime editing reporters and performed genome-scale CRISPR-interference screens. From these screens, a single factor emerged as the strongest mediator of prime editing: the small RNA-binding exonuclease protection factor La. Further investigation revealed that La promotes prime editing across approaches (PE2, PE3, PE4 and PE5), edit types (substitutions, insertions and deletions), endogenous loci and cell types but has no consistent effect on genome-editing approaches that rely on standard, unextended guide RNAs. Previous work has shown that La binds polyuridine tracts at the 3′ ends of RNA polymerase III transcripts2. We found that La functionally interacts with the 3′ ends of polyuridylated prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs). Guided by these results, we developed a prime editor protein (PE7) fused to the RNA-binding, N-terminal domain of La. This editor improved prime editing with expressed pegRNAs and engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs), as well as with synthetic pegRNAs optimized for La binding. Together, our results provide key insights into how prime editing components interact with the cellular environment and suggest general strategies for stabilizing exogenous small RNAs therein."

Small molecule inhibitors of the KRAS(G12C) oncoprotein have demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with multiple cancer types and have led to regulatory approvals for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer2,3. Nevertheless, KRASG12C mutations account for only around 15% of KRAS-mutated cancers4,5, and there are no approved KRAS inhibitors for the majority of patients with tumours containing other common KRAS mutations. Here we describe RMC-7977, a reversible, tri-complex RAS inhibitor with broad-spectrum activity for the active state of both mutant and wild-type KRAS, NRAS and HRAS variants (a RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor). Preclinically, RMC-7977 demonstrated potent activity against RAS-addicted tumours carrying various RAS genotypes, particularly against cancer models with KRAS codon 12 mutations (KRASG12X). Treatment with RMC-7977 led to tumour regression and was well tolerated in diverse RAS-addicted preclinical cancer models. Additionally, RMC-7977 inhibited the growth of KRASG12C cancer models that are resistant to KRAS(G12C) inhibitors owing to restoration of RAS pathway signalling. Thus, RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitors can target multiple oncogenic and wild-type RAS isoforms and have the potential to treat a wide range of RAS-addicted cancers with high unmet clinical need. A related RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor, RMC-6236, is currently under clinical evaluation in patients with KRAS-mutant solid tumours (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05379985)."

Neo-adjuvant olaparib did not improve pCR rates, EFS or OS when added to carboplatin/paclitaxel and anthracycline chemotherapy in patients with TNBC (gBRCAwt).

As >90% of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases are driven by activating mutations in KRAS4, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor RMC-7977 in a comprehensive range of PDAC models. We observed broad and pronounced anti-tumor activity across models following direct RAS inhibition at exposures that were well-tolerated in vivo. Pharmacological analyses revealed divergent responses to RMC-7977 in tumor versus normal tissues. Treated tumors exhibited waves of apoptosis along with sustained proliferative arrest whereas normal tissues underwent only transient decreases in proliferation, with no evidence of apoptosis. In the autochthonous KPC model, RMC-7977 treatment resulted in a profound extension of survival followed by on-treatment relapse. Analysis of relapsed tumors identified Myc copy number gain as a prevalent candidate resistance mechanism, which could be overcome by combinatorial TEAD inhibition in vitro. Together, these data establish a strong preclinical rationale for the use of broad-spectrum RAS-GTP inhibition in the setting of PDAC and identify a promising candidate combination therapeutic regimen to overcome monotherapy resistance."
Bitter taste receptor activation by cholesterol and an intracellular tastant,"Yoojoong Kim, Ryan H. Gumpper, Yongfeng Liu, D. Dewran Kocak, Yan Xiong, Can Cao, Zhijie Deng, Brian E. Krumm, Manish K.

Among the 26 members of the TAS2Rs, TAS2R14 is highly expressed in extraoral tissues and mediates the responses to more than 100 structurally diverse tastants2,3,4,5,6, although the molecular mechanisms for recognizing diverse chemicals and initiating cellular signalling are still poorly understood. Here we report two cryo-electron microscopy structures for TAS2R14 complexed with Ggust (also known as gustducin) and Gi1. Both structures have an orthosteric binding pocket occupied by endogenous cholesterol as well as an intracellular allosteric site bound by the bitter tastant cmpd28.1, including a direct interaction with the α5 helix of Ggust and Gi1. Computational and biochemical studies validate both ligand interactions. Our functional analysis identified cholesterol as an orthosteric agonist and the bitter tastant cmpd28.1 as a positive allosteric modulator with direct agonist activity at TAS2R14. Moreover, the orthosteric pocket is connected to the allosteric site via an elongated cavity, which has a hydrophobic core rich in aromatic residues. Our findings provide insights into the ligand recognition of bitter taste receptors and suggest activities of TAS2R14 beyond bitter taste perception via intracellular allosteric tastants."

This is owing to a number of factors, including the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment that gives rise to poorly persisting and metabolically dysfunctional T cells. Analysis of anti-CD19 CAR T cells used clinically has shown that positive treatment outcomes are associated with a more ‘stem-like’ phenotype and increased mitochondrial mass6,7,8. We therefore sought to identify transcription factors that could enhance CAR T cell fitness and efficacy against solid tumours. Here we show that overexpression of FOXO1 promotes a stem-like phenotype in CAR T cells derived from either healthy human donors or patients, which correlates with improved mitochondrial fitness, persistence and therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This work thus reveals an engineering approach to genetically enforce a favourable metabolic phenotype that has high translational potential to improve the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumours."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-inflammatory mode of action have remained incompletely understood1. Here we show that the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids involve reprogramming of the mitochondrial metabolism of macrophages, resulting in increased and sustained production of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate and consequent inhibition of the inflammatory response. The glucocorticoid receptor interacts with parts of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex whereby glucocorticoids provoke an increase in activity and enable an accelerated and paradoxical flux of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in otherwise pro-inflammatory macrophages. This glucocorticoid-mediated rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism potentiates TCA-cycle-dependent production of itaconate throughout the inflammatory response, thereby interfering with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, artificial blocking of the TCA cycle or genetic deficiency in aconitate decarboxylase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of itaconate synthesis, interferes with the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids and, accordingly, abrogates their beneficial effects during a diverse range of preclinical models of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Our findings provide important insights into the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids and have substantial implications for the design of new classes of anti-inflammatory drugs."

Brain endothelial GSDMD activation mediates inflammatory BBB breakdown,"Chao Wei, Wei Jiang, Ruiyu Wang, Haoyu Zhong, Huabin He, Xinwei Gao, Shilin Zhong, Fengting Yu, Qingchun Guo, Li Zhang, Lisa D.

However, the mechanisms of BBB disruption during infection and inflammatory conditions5,6 remain poorly defined. Here we find that activation of the pore-forming protein GSDMD by the cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensor caspase-11 (refs. 7,8,9), but not by TLR4-induced cytokines, mediates BBB breakdown in response to circulating LPS or during LPS-induced sepsis. Mice deficient in the LBP–CD14 LPS transfer and internalization pathway10,11,12 resist BBB disruption. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that brain endothelial cells (bECs), which express high levels of GSDMD, have a prominent response to circulating LPS. LPS acting on bECs primes Casp11 and Cd14 expression and induces GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization and pyroptosis in vitro and in mice. Electron microscopy shows that this features ultrastructural changes in the disrupted BBB, including pyroptotic endothelia, abnormal appearance of tight junctions and vasculature detachment from the basement membrane. Comprehensive mouse genetic analyses, combined with a bEC-targeting adeno-associated virus system, establish that GSDMD activation in bECs underlies BBB disruption by LPS. Delivery of active GSDMD into bECs bypasses LPS stimulation and opens the BBB. In CASP4-humanized mice, Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae infection disrupts the BBB; this is blocked by expression of a GSDMD-neutralizing nanobody in bECs. Our findings outline a mechanism for inflammatory BBB breakdown, and suggest potential therapies for diseases of the central nervous system associated with BBB impairment."
Digital colloid-enhanced Raman spectroscopy by single-molecule counting,"Xinyuan Bi, Daniel M. Czajkowsky, Zhifeng Shao, Jian Ye",2024-04-17,,"Quantitative detection of various molecules at very low concentrations in complex mixtures has been the main objective in many fields of science and engineering, from the detection of cancer-causing mutagens and early disease markers to environmental pollutants and bioterror agents1,2,3,4,5. Moreover, technologies that can detect these analytes without external labels or modifications are extremely valuable and often preferred6. In this regard, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy can detect molecular species in complex mixtures on the basis only of their intrinsic and unique vibrational signatures7. However, the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for this purpose has been challenging so far because of uncontrollable signal heterogeneity and poor reproducibility at low analyte concentrations8. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that, using digital (nano)colloid-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, reproducible quantification of a broad range of target molecules at very low concentrations can be routinely achieved with single-molecule counting, limited only by the Poisson noise of the measurement process. As metallic colloidal nanoparticles that enhance these vibrational signatures, including hydroxylamine–reduced-silver colloids, can be fabricated at large scale under routine conditions, we anticipate that digital (nano)colloid-enhanced Raman spectroscopy will become the technology of choice for the reliable and ultrasensitive detection of various analytes, including those of great importance for human health."
Refining the impact of genetic evidence on clinical success,"Eric Vallabh Minikel, Jeffery L. Painter, Coco Chengliang Dong, Matthew R. Nelson",2024-04-17,,"The cost of drug discovery and development is driven primarily by failure1, with only about 10% of clinical programmes eventually receiving approval2,3,4. We previously estimated that human genetic evidence doubles the success rate from clinical development to approval5. In this study we leverage the growth in genetic evidence over the past decade to better understand the characteristics that distinguish clinical success and failure. We estimate the probability of success for drug mechanisms with genetic support is 2.6 times greater than those without. This relative success varies among therapy areas and development phases, and improves with increasing confidence in the causal gene, but is largely unaffected by genetic effect size, minor allele frequency or year of discovery. These results indicate we are far from reaching peak genetic insights to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drugs."
7-Dehydrocholesterol dictates ferroptosis sensitivity,"Yaxu Li, Qiao Ran, Qiuhui Duan, Jiali Jin, Yanjin Wang, Lei Yu, Chaojie Wang, Zhenyun Zhu, Xin Chen, Linjun Weng, Zan Li, Jia Wang, Qi Wu, Hui Wang, Hongling Tian, Sihui Song, Zezhi Shan, Qiwei Zhai, Huanlong Qin, Shili Chen, Lan Fang, Huiyong Yin, Hu Zhou, Xuejun Jiang, Ping Wang",2024-01-31,,"Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that is driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, has been implicated in multiple diseases, including cancer1,2,3, degenerative disorders4 and organ ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI)5,6. Here, using genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening, we identified that the enzymes involved in distal cholesterol biosynthesis have pivotal yet opposing roles in regulating ferroptosis through dictating the level of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)—an intermediate metabolite of distal cholesterol biosynthesis that is synthesized by sterol C5-desaturase (SC5D) and metabolized by 7-DHC reductase (DHCR7) for cholesterol synthesis. We found that the pathway components, including MSMO1, CYP51A1, EBP and SC5D, function as potential suppressors of ferroptosis, whereas DHCR7 functions as a pro-ferroptotic gene. Mechanistically, 7-DHC dictates ferroptosis surveillance by using the conjugated diene to exert its anti-phospholipid autoxidation function and shields plasma and mitochondria membranes from phospholipid autoxidation. Importantly, blocking the biosynthesis of endogenous 7-DHC by pharmacological targeting of EBP induces ferroptosis and inhibits tumour growth, whereas increasing the 7-DHC level by inhibiting DHCR7 effectively promotes cancer metastasis and attenuates the progression of kidney IRI, supporting a critical function of this axis in vivo. In conclusion, our data reveal a role of 7-DHC as a natural anti-ferroptotic metabolite and suggest that pharmacological manipulation of 7-DHC levels is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer and IRI."

Here, we identify proferroptotic activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) and an unexpected prosurvival function of its substrate, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Although previous studies suggested that high concentrations of 7-DHC are cytotoxic to developing neurons by favouring lipid peroxidation3, we now show that 7-DHC accumulation confers a robust prosurvival function in cancer cells. Because of its far superior reactivity towards peroxyl radicals, 7-DHC effectively shields (phospho)lipids from autoxidation and subsequent fragmentation. We provide validation in neuroblastoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma xenografts where we demonstrate that the accumulation of 7-DHC is capable of inducing a shift towards a ferroptosis-resistant state in these tumours ultimately resulting in a more aggressive phenotype. Conclusively, our findings provide compelling evidence of a yet-unrecognized antiferroptotic activity of 7-DHC as a cell-intrinsic mechanism that could be exploited by cancer cells to escape ferroptosis."
Naturally occurring T cell mutations enhance engineered T cell therapies,"Julie Garcia, Jay Daniels, Yujin Lee, Iowis Zhu, Kathleen Cheng, Qing Liu, Daniel Goodman, Cassandra Burnett, Calvin Law, Chloë Thienpont, Josef Alavi, Camillia Azimi, Garrett Montgomery, Kole T. Roybal, Jaehyuk Choi",2024-02-07,,"Adoptive T cell therapies have produced exceptional responses in a subset of patients with cancer. However, therapeutic efficacy can be hindered by poor T cell persistence and function1. In human T cell cancers, evolution of the disease positively selects for mutations that improve fitness of T cells in challenging situations analogous to those faced by therapeutic T cells. Therefore, we reasoned that these mutations could be co-opted to improve T cell therapies. Here we systematically screened the effects of 71 mutations from T cell neoplasms on T cell signalling, cytokine production and in vivo persistence in tumours. We identify a gene fusion, CARD11–PIK3R3, found in a CD4+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma2, that augments CARD11–BCL10–MALT1 complex signalling and anti-tumour efficacy of therapeutic T cells in several immunotherapy-refractory models in an antigen-dependent manner. Underscoring its potential to be deployed safely, CARD11–PIK3R3-expressing cells were followed up to 418 days after T cell transfer in vivo without evidence of malignant transformation. Collectively, our results indicate that exploiting naturally occurring mutations represents a promising approach to explore the extremes of T cell biology and discover how solutions derived from evolution of malignant T cells can improve a broad range of T cell therapies."

Although MN are a hallmark of ageing and diseases associated with genomic instability, the catalogue of genetic players that regulate the generation of MN remains to be determined. Here we analyse 997 mouse mutant lines, revealing 145 genes whose loss significantly increases (n = 71) or decreases (n = 74) MN formation, including many genes whose orthologues are linked to human disease. We found that mice null for Dscc1, which showed the most significant increase in MN, also displayed a range of phenotypes characteristic of patients with cohesinopathy disorders. After validating the DSCC1-associated MN instability phenotype in human cells, we used genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening to define synthetic lethal and synthetic rescue interactors. We found that the loss of SIRT1 can rescue phenotypes associated with DSCC1 loss in a manner paralleling restoration of protein acetylation of SMC3. Our study reveals factors involved in maintaining genomic stability and shows how this information can be used to identify mechanisms that are relevant to human disease biology1."

The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated1,2,3,4,5,6,7. However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1–EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2–compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations, TET2 mutation or elevated DNMT3A expression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies."
Resilient anatomy and local plasticity of naive and stress haematopoiesis,"Qingqing Wu, Jizhou Zhang, Sumit Kumar, Siyu Shen, Morgan Kincaid, Courtney B.

Matthew Kofron, Daniel Lucas",2024-03-20,,"The bone marrow adjusts blood cell production to meet physiological demands in response to insults. The spatial organization of normal and stress responses are unknown owing to the lack of methods to visualize most steps of blood production. Here we develop strategies to image multipotent haematopoiesis, erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis in mice. We combine these with imaging of myelopoiesis1 to define the anatomy of normal and stress haematopoiesis. In the steady state, across the skeleton, single stem cells and multipotent progenitors distribute through the marrow enriched near megakaryocytes. Lineage-committed progenitors are recruited to blood vessels, where they contribute to lineage-specific microanatomical structures composed of progenitors and immature cells, which function as the production sites for each major blood lineage. This overall anatomy is resilient to insults, as it was maintained after haemorrhage, systemic bacterial infection and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment, and during ageing. Production sites enable haematopoietic plasticity as they differentially and selectively modulate their numbers and output in response to insults. We found that stress responses are variable across the skeleton: the tibia and the sternum respond in opposite ways to G-CSF, and the skull does not increase erythropoiesis after haemorrhage. Our studies enable in situ analyses of haematopoiesis, define the anatomy of normal and stress responses, identify discrete microanatomical production sites that confer plasticity to haematopoiesis, and uncover unprecedented heterogeneity of stress responses across the skeleton."

The primary infection is often asymptomatic or causes infectious mononucleosis (IM), a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disorder3. Selective vulnerability to EBV has been reported in association with inherited mutations impairing T cell immunity to EBV4. Here we report biallelic loss-of-function variants in IL27RA that underlie an acute and severe primary EBV infection with a nevertheless favourable outcome requiring a minimal treatment. One mutant allele (rs201107107) was enriched in the Finnish population (minor allele frequency = 0.0068) and carried a high risk of severe infectious mononucleosis when homozygous. IL27RA encodes the IL-27 receptor alpha subunit5,6. In the absence of IL-27RA, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by IL-27 is abolished in T cells. In in vitro studies, IL-27 exerts a synergistic effect on T-cell-receptor-dependent T cell proliferation7 that is deficient in cells from the patients, leading to impaired expansion of potent anti-EBV effector cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. IL-27 is produced by EBV-infected B lymphocytes and an IL-27RA–IL-27 autocrine loop is required for the maintenance of EBV-transformed B cells. This potentially explains the eventual favourable outcome of the EBV-induced viral disease in patients with IL-27RA deficiency. Furthermore, we identified neutralizing anti-IL-27 autoantibodies in most individuals who developed sporadic infectious mononucleosis and chronic EBV infection. These results demonstrate the critical role of IL-27RA–IL-27 in immunity to EBV, but also the hijacking of this defence by EBV to promote the expansion of infected transformed B cells."

Adults with T cell leukaemias and lymphomas, collectively called T cell cancers, have short survival10,11 and lack such targeted therapies. Thus, T cell cancers particularly warrant the development of CAR T cells and antibodies to improve patient outcomes. Preclinical studies showed that targeting T cell receptor β-chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) can kill cancerous T cells while preserving sufficient healthy T cells to maintain immunity12, making TRBC1 an attractive target to treat T cell cancers. However, the first-in-human clinical trial of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells reported a low response rate and unexplained loss of anti-TRBC1 CAR T cells13,14. Here we demonstrate that CAR T cells are lost due to killing by the patient’s normal T cells, reducing their efficacy. To circumvent this issue, we developed an antibody–drug conjugate that could kill TRBC1+ cancer cells in vitro and cure human T cell cancers in mouse models. The anti-TRBC1 antibody–drug conjugate may provide an optimal format for TRBC1 targeting and produce superior responses in patients with T cell cancers."

M. Roberts",2024-03-27,,"Whereas oncogenes can potentially be inhibited with small molecules, the loss of tumour suppressors is more common and is problematic because the tumour-suppressor proteins are no longer present to be targeted. Notable examples include SMARCB1-mutant cancers, which are highly lethal malignancies driven by the inactivation of a subunit of SWI/SNF (also known as BAF) chromatin-remodelling complexes. Here, to generate mechanistic insights into the consequences of SMARCB1 mutation and to identify vulnerabilities, we contributed 14 SMARCB1-mutant cell lines to a near genome-wide CRISPR screen as part of the Cancer Dependency Map Project1,2,3. We report that the little-studied gene DDB1–CUL4-associated factor 5 (DCAF5) is required for the survival of SMARCB1-mutant cancers. We show that DCAF5 has a quality-control function for SWI/SNF complexes and promotes the degradation of incompletely assembled SWI/SNF complexes in the absence of SMARCB1. After depletion of DCAF5, SMARCB1-deficient SWI/SNF complexes reaccumulate, bind to target loci and restore SWI/SNF-mediated gene expression to levels that are sufficient to reverse the cancer state, including in vivo. Consequently, cancer results not from the loss of SMARCB1 function per se, but rather from DCAF5-mediated degradation of SWI/SNF complexes. These data indicate that therapeutic targeting of ubiquitin-mediated quality-control factors may effectively reverse the malignant state of some cancers driven by disruption of tumour suppressor complexes."

This is owing to a number of factors, including the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment that gives rise to poorly persisting and metabolically dysfunctional T cells. Analysis of anti-CD19 CAR T cells used clinically has shown that positive treatment outcomes are associated with a more ‘stem-like’ phenotype and increased mitochondrial mass6,7,8. We therefore sought to identify transcription factors that could enhance CAR T cell fitness and efficacy against solid tumours. Here we show that overexpression of FOXO1 promotes a stem-like phenotype in CAR T cells derived from either healthy human donors or patients, which correlates with improved mitochondrial fitness, persistence and therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This work thus reveals an engineering approach to genetically enforce a favourable metabolic phenotype that has high translational potential to improve the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumours."
Nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus is a hub for cerebrospinal fluid drainage,"Jin-Hui Yoon, Hokyung Jin, Hae Jin Kim, Seon Pyo Hong, Myung Jin Yang, Ji Hoon Ahn, Young-Chan Kim, Jincheol Seo, Yongjeon Lee, Donald M. McDonald, Michael J.

Here, using fluorescent CSF tracers in Prox1-GFP lymphatic reporter mice18, we found that the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus is a major hub for CSF outflow to deep cervical lymph nodes. This plexus had unusual valves and short lymphangions but no smooth-muscle coverage, whereas downstream deep cervical lymphatics had typical semilunar valves, long lymphangions and smooth muscle coverage that transported CSF to the deep cervical lymph nodes. α-Adrenergic and nitric oxide signalling in the smooth muscle cells regulated CSF drainage through the transport properties of deep cervical lymphatics. During ageing, the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus atrophied, but deep cervical lymphatics were not similarly altered, and CSF outflow could still be increased by adrenergic or nitric oxide signalling. Single-cell analysis of gene expression in lymphatic endothelial cells of the nasopharyngeal plexus of aged mice revealed increased type I interferon signalling and other inflammatory cytokines. The importance of evidence for the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus functioning as a CSF outflow hub is highlighted by its regression during ageing. Yet, the ageing-resistant pharmacological activation of deep cervical lymphatic transport towards lymph nodes can still increase CSF outflow, offering an approach for augmenting CSF clearance in age-related neurological conditions in which greater efflux would be beneficial."

Emerging research demonstrates that changes in the brain are often reflected in the eye, particularly in the retina1. Still, the possibility of an immunological nexus between the posterior eye and the rest of the CNS tissues remains unexplored. Here, studying immune responses to herpes simplex virus in the brain, we observed that intravitreal immunization protects mice against intracranial viral challenge. This protection extended to bacteria and even tumours, allowing therapeutic immune responses against glioblastoma through intravitreal immunization. We further show that the anterior and posterior compartments of the eye have distinct lymphatic drainage systems, with the latter draining to the deep cervical lymph nodes through lymphatic vasculature in the optic nerve sheath. This posterior lymphatic drainage, like that of meningeal lymphatics, could be modulated by the lymphatic stimulator VEGFC. Conversely, we show that inhibition of lymphatic signalling on the optic nerve could overcome a major limitation in gene therapy by diminishing the immune response to adeno-associated virus and ensuring continued efficacy after multiple doses. These results reveal a shared lymphatic circuit able to mount a unified immune response between the posterior eye and the brain, highlighting an understudied immunological feature of the eye and opening up the potential for new therapeutic strategies in ocular and CNS diseases."
