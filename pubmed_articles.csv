While generating 17.2 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2021, the true significance of these developments lies in their ability to enhance cancer patient outcomes. Despite the proven efficacy of mAbs in inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathways, they face significant challenges, including limited response rates, high production costs, missing oral bioavailability, and extended half-lives that can lead to immune-related adverse effects.

keytruda,Optimizing Inpatient Care for Lung Cancer Patients with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor- Related Pneumonitis Using a Clinical Care Pathway Algorithm.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38659939,"Purpose Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI-P) is a condition associated with high mortality, necessitating prompt recognition and treatment initiation. This study aimed to assess the impact of implementing a clinical care pathway algorithm on reducing the time to treatment for ICI-P. Methods Patients with lung cancer and suspected ICI-P were enrolled, and a multi-modal intervention promoting algorithm use was implemented in two phases. Pre- and post-intervention analyses were conducted to evaluate the primary outcome of time from ICI-P diagnosis to treatment initiation. Results Of the 82 patients admitted with suspected ICI-P, 73.17% were confirmed to have ICI-P, predominantly associated with non-small cell lung cancer (91.67%) and stage IV disease (95%). Pembrolizumab was the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor (55%). The mean times to treatment were 2.37 days in the pre-intervention phase and, 3.07 days ( p =0.46), and 1.27 days ( p =0.40) in the post-intervention phases 1 and 2, respectively. Utilization of the immunotoxicity order set significantly increased from 0% to 27.27% (p = 0.04) after phase 2. While there were no significant changes in ICU admissions or inpatient mortality, outpatient pulmonology follow-ups increased statistically significantly, demonstrating enhanced continuity of care. The overall mortality for patients with ICI-P was 22%, underscoring the urgency of optimizing management strategies. Notably, all patients discharged on high-dose corticosteroids received appropriate gastrointestinal prophylaxis and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia infections at the end of phase 2. Conclusion Implementing a clinical care pathway algorithm for ICI-P management standardizes care practices and enhances patient outcomes, underscoring the importance of structured approaches.",,,2024 Apr 12:rs.3.rs-4209489.

However, there is insufficient information on PCP occurrence despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis. We encountered a 57-year-old woman with locally advanced breast cancer developing PCP despite prophylactic intake of TMP-SMX, during treatment with prednisolone for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) induced by pembrolizumab. This case underscores the need to pay attention to the possibility of PCP development even during TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Dosage and duration adjustments according to the patient's condition and weight may be required.","Affiliations

keytruda,Molecular insights into clinical trials for immune checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal cancer: Unravelling challenges and future directions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38659481,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease with diverse etiologies and clinical outcomes. Despite considerable progress in development of CRC therapeutics, challenges remain regarding the diagnosis and management of advanced stage metastatic CRC (mCRC). In particular, the five-year survival rate is very low since mCRC is currently rarely curable. Over the past decade, cancer treatment has significantly improved with the introduction of cancer immunotherapies, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therapies aimed at blocking immune checkpoints such as PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 target inhibitory pathways of the immune system, and thereby enhance anti-tumor immunity. These therapies thus have shown promising results in many clinical trials alone or in combination. The efficacy and safety of immunotherapy, either alone or in combination with CRC, have been investigated in several clinical trials. Clinical trials, including KEYNOTE-164 and CheckMate 142, have led to Food and Drug Administration approval of the PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab, respectively, for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high or deficient mismatch repair CRC. Unfortunately, these drugs benefit only a small percentage of patients, with the benefits of immunotherapy remaining elusive for the vast majority of CRC patients. To this end, primary and secondary resistance to immunotherapy remains a significant issue, and further research is necessary to optimize the use of immunotherapy in CRC and identify biomarkers to predict the response. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical trials involving immune checkpoint inhibitors in CRC. The underlying rationale, challenges faced, and potential future steps to improve the prognosis and enhance the likelihood of successful trials in this field are discussed.","Affiliations

keytruda,First-line immunotherapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: an updated network meta-analysis including triplet therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38659099,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare the differential efficacy of first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combined therapies among patients with intermediate- and poor-risk metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), as recently, the efficacy of triplet therapy comprising nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus cabozantinib has been published.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Three databases were searched in December 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysing oncological outcomes in patients with mRCC treated with first-line ICI-based combined therapies. We performed network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs), in patients with intermediate- and poor-risk mRCC; we also assessed treatment-related adverse events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, seven RCTs were included in the meta-analyses and NMAs. Treatment ranking analysis revealed that pembrolizumab + lenvatinib (99%) had the highest likelihood of improved PFS, followed by nivolumab + cabozantinib (79%), and nivolumab + ipilimumab + cabozantinib (77%). Notably, compared to nivolumab + cabozantinib, adding ipilimumab to nivolumab + cabozantinib did not improve PFS (hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.72-1.43). Regarding ORRs, treatment ranking analysis also revealed that pembrolizumab + lenvatinib had the highest likelihood of providing better ORRs (99.7%). The likelihoods of improved PFS and ORRs of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib were true in both International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our analyses confirmed the robust efficacy of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib as first-line treatment for patients with intermediate or poor IMDC risk mRCC. Triplet therapy did not result in superior efficacy. Considering both toxicity and the lack of mature overall survival data, triplet therapy should only be considered in selected patients.","Affiliations

keytruda,Recent updates in the therapeutic uses of Pembrolizumab: a brief narrative review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38658461,"Introduction:
        
      
      Treatment of cancer has been improved with the discovery of biological drugs that act as immune checkpoint inhibitors. In 2017, FDA designated pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor employed in immunotherapy, as the first tissue-agnostic cancer treatment.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To review pembrolizumab's use in oncology, gather and examine the latest discoveries regarding the effectiveness of pembrolizumab in cancer treatment.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      A literature review was conducted through PubMed(Medline) from January 2015 to December 2023 using ""pembrolizumab"", ""cancer"" and ""treatment"" as search terms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Pembrolizumab demonstrated effectiveness as primary treatment for metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, unresectable esophageal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and alternative treatment for notable triple-negative breast cancer, biliary, colorectal, endometrial, renal cell, cervical carcinoma, and high microsatellite instability or mismatch repair deficiencies tumors. Pediatric applications include treatment for refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Evolving research on pembrolizumab allows a deeper clinical understanding, despite challenges as variable patient responses. Pembrolizumab has emerged as a pivotal breakthrough in cancer treatment, improving patient outcomes and safety.","Affiliations

keytruda,Optimizing Inpatient Care for Lung Cancer Patients with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor- Related Pneumonitis Using a Clinical Care Pathway Algorithm.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38659939,"Purpose Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI-P) is a condition associated with high mortality, necessitating prompt recognition and treatment initiation. This study aimed to assess the impact of implementing a clinical care pathway algorithm on reducing the time to treatment for ICI-P. Methods Patients with lung cancer and suspected ICI-P were enrolled, and a multi-modal intervention promoting algorithm use was implemented in two phases. Pre- and post-intervention analyses were conducted to evaluate the primary outcome of time from ICI-P diagnosis to treatment initiation. Results Of the 82 patients admitted with suspected ICI-P, 73.17% were confirmed to have ICI-P, predominantly associated with non-small cell lung cancer (91.67%) and stage IV disease (95%). Pembrolizumab was the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor (55%). The mean times to treatment were 2.37 days in the pre-intervention phase and, 3.07 days ( p =0.46), and 1.27 days ( p =0.40) in the post-intervention phases 1 and 2, respectively. Utilization of the immunotoxicity order set significantly increased from 0% to 27.27% (p = 0.04) after phase 2. While there were no significant changes in ICU admissions or inpatient mortality, outpatient pulmonology follow-ups increased statistically significantly, demonstrating enhanced continuity of care. The overall mortality for patients with ICI-P was 22%, underscoring the urgency of optimizing management strategies. Notably, all patients discharged on high-dose corticosteroids received appropriate gastrointestinal prophylaxis and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia infections at the end of phase 2. Conclusion Implementing a clinical care pathway algorithm for ICI-P management standardizes care practices and enhances patient outcomes, underscoring the importance of structured approaches.",,,2024 Apr 12:rs.3.rs-4209489.
keytruda,Pneumocystis Pneumonia in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Despite Prophylactic Use of Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole During Prednisolone Treatment for a Pembrolizumab-Induced Immune-Related Adverse Event: A Case Report.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38659518,"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) primarily affects immunosuppressed patients, with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) commonly used for prophylaxis. However, there is insufficient information on PCP occurrence despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis. We encountered a 57-year-old woman with locally advanced breast cancer developing PCP despite prophylactic intake of TMP-SMX, during treatment with prednisolone for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) induced by pembrolizumab. This case underscores the need to pay attention to the possibility of PCP development even during TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Dosage and duration adjustments according to the patient's condition and weight may be required.","Affiliations

keytruda,Molecular insights into clinical trials for immune checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal cancer: Unravelling challenges and future directions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38659481,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease with diverse etiologies and clinical outcomes. Despite considerable progress in development of CRC therapeutics, challenges remain regarding the diagnosis and management of advanced stage metastatic CRC (mCRC). In particular, the five-year survival rate is very low since mCRC is currently rarely curable. Over the past decade, cancer treatment has significantly improved with the introduction of cancer immunotherapies, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therapies aimed at blocking immune checkpoints such as PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 target inhibitory pathways of the immune system, and thereby enhance anti-tumor immunity. These therapies thus have shown promising results in many clinical trials alone or in combination. The efficacy and safety of immunotherapy, either alone or in combination with CRC, have been investigated in several clinical trials. Clinical trials, including KEYNOTE-164 and CheckMate 142, have led to Food and Drug Administration approval of the PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab, respectively, for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high or deficient mismatch repair CRC. Unfortunately, these drugs benefit only a small percentage of patients, with the benefits of immunotherapy remaining elusive for the vast majority of CRC patients. To this end, primary and secondary resistance to immunotherapy remains a significant issue, and further research is necessary to optimize the use of immunotherapy in CRC and identify biomarkers to predict the response. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical trials involving immune checkpoint inhibitors in CRC. The underlying rationale, challenges faced, and potential future steps to improve the prognosis and enhance the likelihood of successful trials in this field are discussed.","Affiliations

keytruda,First-line immunotherapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: an updated network meta-analysis including triplet therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38659099,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare the differential efficacy of first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combined therapies among patients with intermediate- and poor-risk metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), as recently, the efficacy of triplet therapy comprising nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus cabozantinib has been published.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Three databases were searched in December 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysing oncological outcomes in patients with mRCC treated with first-line ICI-based combined therapies. We performed network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs), in patients with intermediate- and poor-risk mRCC; we also assessed treatment-related adverse events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, seven RCTs were included in the meta-analyses and NMAs. Treatment ranking analysis revealed that pembrolizumab + lenvatinib (99%) had the highest likelihood of improved PFS, followed by nivolumab + cabozantinib (79%), and nivolumab + ipilimumab + cabozantinib (77%). Notably, compared to nivolumab + cabozantinib, adding ipilimumab to nivolumab + cabozantinib did not improve PFS (hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.72-1.43). Regarding ORRs, treatment ranking analysis also revealed that pembrolizumab + lenvatinib had the highest likelihood of providing better ORRs (99.7%). The likelihoods of improved PFS and ORRs of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib were true in both International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our analyses confirmed the robust efficacy of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib as first-line treatment for patients with intermediate or poor IMDC risk mRCC. Triplet therapy did not result in superior efficacy. Considering both toxicity and the lack of mature overall survival data, triplet therapy should only be considered in selected patients.","Affiliations
