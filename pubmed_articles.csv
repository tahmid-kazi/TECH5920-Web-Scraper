cancer,Knowledge-Based Therapeutics for Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle-Deficient Cancers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503501,"With the foundation pre-laid, research in the new millennium has readily excavated and expanded upon the architectural framework laid out by Otto Warburg's seminal work in a new wave of ""westward expansion,"" ever widening our understanding of cancer metabolism beyond the telescopic vision seen over a century ago. On this path, the unique circuitry of the cancer metabolic program has been elucidated, illuminating mutations of conserved cellular pathways implicated in tumorigenesis. Paramount among these are mutations in tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase, and fumarate hydratase, leading to deleterious accumulations in metabolic intermediates, ""oncometabolites,"" the pilots of the disease process. In this work, we seek to reflect on the advancements in the field in recent years, updating knowledge on the exact biochemical mechanisms at the helm of the tumor, providing rationale for clinical trials currently underway, and anticipating directions for the future on this expansive frontier.","Daniel Peled

cancer,Addressing Biological Questions with Preclinical Cancer Imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503500,"The broad application of noninvasive imaging has transformed preclinical cancer research, providing a powerful means to measure dynamic processes in living animals. While imaging technologies are routinely used to monitor tumor growth in model systems, their greatest potential lies in their ability to answer fundamental biological questions. Here we present the broad range of potential imaging applications according to the needs of a cancer biologist with a focus on some of the common biological processes that can be used to visualize and measure. Topics include imaging metastasis; biophysical properties such as perfusion, diffusion, oxygenation, and stiffness; imaging the immune system and tumor microenvironment; and imaging tumor metabolism. We also discuss the general ability of each approach and the level of training needed to both acquire and analyze images. The overall goal is to provide a practical guide for cancer biologists interested in answering biological questions with preclinical imaging technologies.","Chris B Damoci

cancer,Tracing the Diverse Paths of One-Carbon Metabolism in Cancer and Beyond.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503499,"One-carbon (1C) metabolism is a network of biochemical reactions distributed across organelles that delivers folate-activated 1C units to support macromolecule synthesis, methylation, and reductive homeostasis. Fluxes through these pathways are up-regulated in highly proliferative cancer cells, and anti-folates, which target enzymes within the 1C pathway, have long been used in the treatment of cancer. In this work, we review fundamental aspects of 1C metabolism and place it in context with other biosynthetic and redox pathways, such that 1C metabolism acts to bridge pathways across compartments. We further discuss the importance of stable-isotope-tracing techniques combined with mass spectrometry analysis to study 1C metabolism and conclude by highlighting therapeutic approaches that could exploit cancer cells' dependency on 1C metabolism.","Esther W Lim

cancer,Presence and utility of electrocardiographic abnormalities in long-term childhood cancer survivors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503487,"Background:
        
      
      We assessed the prevalence and diagnostic value of ECG abnormalities for cardiomyopathy surveillance in childhood cancer survivors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this cross-sectional study, 1381 survivors (≥5 years) from the Dutch Childhood Cancer Survivor Study part 2 and 272 siblings underwent a long-term follow-up ECG and echocardiography. We compared ECG abnormality prevalences using the Minnesota Code between survivors and siblings, and within biplane left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) categories. Among 880 survivors who received anthracycline, mitoxantrone or heart radiotherapy, logistic regression models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator identified ECG abnormalities associated with three abnormal LVEF categories (<52% in male/<54% in female, <50% and <45%). We assessed the overall contribution of these ECG abnormalities to clinical regression models predicting abnormal LVEF, assuming an absence of systolic dysfunction with a <1% threshold probability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      16% of survivors (52% female, mean age 34.7 years) and 14% of siblings had major ECG abnormalities. ECG abnormalities increased with decreasing LVEF. Integrating selected ECG data into the baseline model significantly improved prediction of sex-specific abnormal LVEF (c-statistic 0.66 vs 0.71), LVEF <50% (0.66 vs 0.76) and LVEF <45% (0.80 vs 0.86). While no survivor met the preset probability threshold in the first two models, the third model used five ECG variables to predict LVEF <45% and was applicable for ruling out (sensitivity 93%, specificity 56%, negative predictive value 99.6%). Calibration and internal validation tests performed well.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A clinical prediction model with ECG data (left bundle branch block, left atrial enlargement, left heart axis, Cornell's criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy and heart rate) may aid in ruling out LVEF <45%.","Esmée C de Baat

cancer,"Knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and barriers pertaining to genetic literacy among surgeons: a scoping review.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503461,"Background:
        
      
      The rapid evolution of genetic technologies and utilization of genetic information for clinical decision-making has necessitated increased surgeon participation in genetic counselling, testing, and appropriate referral of patients for genetic services, without formal training in genetics. We performed a scoping review to describe surgeons' knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and barriers pertaining to genetic literacy in the management of patients who had confirmed cancer or who were potentially genetically at risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. We performed a comprehensive literature search, and 2 reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion. These studies included surgeons involved in the care of patients with confirmed gastrointestinal, breast, and endocrine and neuroendocrine cancers, or patients who were potentially genetically at risk for these cancers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We analyzed 17 studies, all of which used survey or interview-based formats. Many surgeons engaged in genetic counselling, testing, and referral, but reported low confidence and comfort in doing so. Knowledge assessments showed lower confidence in identifying genetic inheritance patterns and hereditary cancer syndromes, but awareness was higher among surgeons with greater clinical volume or subspecialty training in oncology. Surgeons felt responsible for facilitating these services and explicitly requested educational support in genetics. Barriers to genetic literacy were identified and catalogued at patient, surgeon, and system levels.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Surgeons frequently engage in genetics-related tasks despite a lack of formal genetics training, and often report low knowledge, comfort, and confidence in providing such services. We have identified several barriers to genetic literacy that can be used to develop interventions to enhance genetic literacy among surgeons.","Zuhaib M Mir

The potential for sialic acid to obscure underlying structures has long been postulated, but the means by which such structural changes directly affect biological processes continues to be elucidated. Here, we appraise the growing body of literature detailing the importance of sialic acid for the generation, differentiation, function and death of haematopoietic cells. We conclude that sialylation is a critical post-translational modification utilized in haematopoiesis to meet the dynamic needs of the organism by enforcing rapid changes in availability of lineage-specific cell types. Though long thought to be generated only cell-autonomously within the intracellular ER-Golgi secretory apparatus, emerging data also demonstrate previously unexpected diversity in the mechanisms of sialylation. Emphasis is afforded to the mechanism of extrinsic sialylation, whereby extracellular enzymes remodel cell surface and extracellular glycans, supported by charged sugar donor molecules from activated platelets.","Eric Edward Irons

cancer,Investigating the air quality surrounding new schools in England: polluted playgrounds and school buildings are a source of avoidable harm.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503436,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess levels of pollutants at the sites of new schools and whether pupils are likely to be protected from associated risks.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Air pollution causes damage to children's health by increasing respiratory tract infection rates, asthma exacerbations, allergies and childhood cancers. Further effects include poorer neurocognitive outcomes and multisystemic illness in adulthood.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We obtained a list of all 187 proposed new schools in England from 2017 to 2025 and found locations for 147 of them. We assessed air quality against WHO air quality targets and the air quality percentile of the location relative to pollution levels across the UK. We review relevant legislation and guidance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our analysis found 86% of new schools (126/147) exceeded all three WHO targets, and every location exceeded at least one. Nationally, 76% (112/147) of sites were in the 60th or greater pollution percentile. Within London, the median pollution percentile was the 90th, with a minimum of 76th and maximum of 99th (IQR=83 rd to 94th).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The guidance for school proposals does not include any requirement to assess air quality at the identified site. Building regulations also fail to consider how widespread poor air quality is, and significantly underestimates the levels of major air pollutants surrounding schools. Therefore it is unlikely that adequate action to reduce pupil and staff exposure is undertaken.We argue that air quality assessment should be mandatory at the proposal and planning stage of any new school building and that national guidance and legislation urgently needs to be updated.","Yasmin Mahfouz

cancer,Multifunctional iron-apigenin nanocomplex conducting photothermal therapy and triggering augmented immune response for triple negative breast cancer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503397,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a formidable challenge due to its low sensitivity to many chemotherapeutic drugs and a relatively low overall survival rate in clinical practice. Photothermal therapy has recently garnered substantial interest in cancer treatment, owing to its swift therapeutic effectiveness and minimal impact on normal cells. Metal-polyphenol nanostructures have recently garnered significant attention as photothermal transduction agents due to their facile preparation and favorable photothermal properties. In this study, we employed a coordinated approach involving Fe3+ and apigenin, a polyphenol compound, to construct the nanostructure (nFeAPG), with the assistance of β-CD and DSPE-PEG facilitating the formation of the complex nanostructure. In vitro research demonstrated that the formed nFeAPG could induce cell death by elevating intracellular oxidative stress, inhibiting antioxidative system, and promoting apoptosis and ferroptosis, and near infrared spectrum irradiation further strengthen the therapeutic outcome. In 4T1 tumor bearing mice, nFeAPG could effectively accumulate into tumor site and exhibit commendable control over tumor growth. Futher analysis demonstrated that nFeAPG ameliorated the suppressed immune microenvironment by augmenting the response of DC cells and T cells. This study underscores that nFeAPG encompasses a multifaceted capacity to combat TNBC, holding promise as a compelling therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment.","Ruijie Chen

cancer,A single bout of vigorous intensity exercise enhances the efficacy of rituximab against autologous human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B-cells ex vivo.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503395,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is characterised by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mature B-cells and is often treated with rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy. Rituximab often fails to induce stringent disease eradication, due in part to failure of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity which relies on natural killer (NK)-cells binding to rituximab-bound CD20 on B-cells. CLL cells are diffusely spread across lymphoid and other bodily tissues, and ADCC resistance in survival niches may be due to several factors including low NK-cell frequency and a suppressive stromal environment that promotes CLL cell survival. It is well established that exercise bouts induce a transient relocation of NK-cells and B-cells into peripheral blood, which could be harnessed to enhance the efficacy of rituximab in CLL by relocating both target and effector cells together with rituximab in blood. In this pilot study, n = 20 patients with treatment-naïve CLL completed a bout of cycling 15 % above their anaerobic threshold for ∼ 30-minutes, with blood samples collected pre-, immediately post-, and 1-hour post-exercise. Flow cytometry revealed that exercise evoked a 254 % increase in effector (CD3-CD56+CD16+) NK-cells in blood, respectively, and a 67 % increase in CD5+CD19+CD20+ CLL cells in blood (all p < 0.005). NK-cells were isolated from blood samples pre-, and immediately post-exercise and incubated with primary isolated CLL cells with or without the presence of rituximab to determine specific lysis using a calcein-release assay. Rituximab-mediated cell lysis increased by 129 % following exercise (p < 0.001). Direct NK-cell lysis of CLL cells - independent of rituximab - was unchanged following exercise (p = 0.25). We conclude that exercise improved the efficacy of rituximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against autologous CLL cells ex vivo and propose that exercise should be explored as a means of enhancing clinical responses in patients receiving anti-CD20 immunotherapy.","Harrison D Collier-Bain

cancer,The use of methylene blue to control the tumor oxygenation level.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503388,"Background:
        
      
      Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of many tumors. It promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion and can reduce the effectiveness of many types of cancer treatment.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of methylene blue (MB) and its impact on the tumor oxygenation level at mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model using spectroscopic methods.
    


          Approach:
        
      
      The pharmacokinetics of MB were studied qualitatively and quantitatively using video fluorescence imaging and fluorescence spectroscopy. The degree of hemoglobin oxygenation in vivo was examined by calculating hemoglobin optical absorption from the measured diffuse reflectance spectra. The distribution of MB fluorescence and the lifetime of NADH were analyzed using laser scanning microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to assess cellular metabolism.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After intravenous administration of MB at 10-20 mg/kg, it quickly transitioned in the tumor to a colorless leucomethylene blue, with maximum accumulation in the tumor occurring after 5-10 minutes. A concentration of 10 mg/kg resulted in a relative increase of the tumor oxygenation level for small tumors (volume 50-75 mm3) and normal tissue 120 minutes after the introduction of MB. A shift in tumor metabolism towards oxidative phosphorylation (according to the lifetime of the NADH coenzyme) was measured using FLIM method after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg of MB. Intravenous administration of MB at 20 mg/kg results in a long-term decrease in oxygenation, which persisted for at least 120 minutes after the administration and did not return to its initial level.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Administration of MB at 10 mg/kg shown to increase tumor oxygenation level, potentially leading to more effective antitumor therapy. However, at higher doses (20 mg/kg), MB may cause long-term decrease in oxygenation.","Daria Pominova

immunotherapy,Adjuvant Wilms' tumour 1-specific dendritic cell immunotherapy complementing conventional therapy for paediatric patients with high-grade glioma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma: protocol of a monocentric phase I/II clinical trial in Belgium.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503417,"Introduction:
        
      
      Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and paediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) are aggressive glial tumours, for which conventional treatment modalities fall short. Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is being investigated as a promising and safe adjuvant therapy. The Wilms' tumour protein (WT1) is a potent target for this type of antigen-specific immunotherapy and is overexpressed in DIPG and pHGG. Based on this, we designed a non-randomised phase I/II trial, assessing the feasibility and safety of WT1 mRNA-loaded DC (WT1/DC) immunotherapy in combination with conventional treatment in pHGG and DIPG.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      10 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed or pretreated HGG or DIPG were treated according to the trial protocol. The trial protocol consists of leukapheresis of mononuclear cells, the manufacturing of autologous WT1/DC vaccines and the combination of WT1/DC-vaccine immunotherapy with conventional antiglioma treatment. In newly diagnosed patients, this comprises chemoradiation (oral temozolomide 90 mg/m2 daily+radiotherapy 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions) followed by three induction WT1/DC vaccines (8-10×106 cells/vaccine) given on a weekly basis and a chemoimmunotherapy booster phase consisting of six 28-day cycles of oral temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2 on days 1-5) and a WT1/DC vaccine on day 21. In pretreated patients, the induction and booster phase are combined with best possible antiglioma treatment at hand. Primary objectives are to assess the feasibility of the production of mRNA-electroporated WT1/DC vaccines in this patient population and to assess the safety and feasibility of combining conventional antiglioma treatment with the proposed immunotherapy. Secondary objectives are to investigate in vivo immunogenicity of WT1/DC vaccination and to assess disease-specific and general quality of life.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      The ethics committee of the Antwerp University Hospital and the University of Antwerp granted ethics approval. Results of the clinical trial will be shared through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentations at conferences.

immunotherapy,A single bout of vigorous intensity exercise enhances the efficacy of rituximab against autologous human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B-cells ex vivo.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503395,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is characterised by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mature B-cells and is often treated with rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy. Rituximab often fails to induce stringent disease eradication, due in part to failure of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity which relies on natural killer (NK)-cells binding to rituximab-bound CD20 on B-cells. CLL cells are diffusely spread across lymphoid and other bodily tissues, and ADCC resistance in survival niches may be due to several factors including low NK-cell frequency and a suppressive stromal environment that promotes CLL cell survival. It is well established that exercise bouts induce a transient relocation of NK-cells and B-cells into peripheral blood, which could be harnessed to enhance the efficacy of rituximab in CLL by relocating both target and effector cells together with rituximab in blood. In this pilot study, n = 20 patients with treatment-naïve CLL completed a bout of cycling 15 % above their anaerobic threshold for ∼ 30-minutes, with blood samples collected pre-, immediately post-, and 1-hour post-exercise. Flow cytometry revealed that exercise evoked a 254 % increase in effector (CD3-CD56+CD16+) NK-cells in blood, respectively, and a 67 % increase in CD5+CD19+CD20+ CLL cells in blood (all p < 0.005). NK-cells were isolated from blood samples pre-, and immediately post-exercise and incubated with primary isolated CLL cells with or without the presence of rituximab to determine specific lysis using a calcein-release assay. Rituximab-mediated cell lysis increased by 129 % following exercise (p < 0.001). Direct NK-cell lysis of CLL cells - independent of rituximab - was unchanged following exercise (p = 0.25). We conclude that exercise improved the efficacy of rituximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against autologous CLL cells ex vivo and propose that exercise should be explored as a means of enhancing clinical responses in patients receiving anti-CD20 immunotherapy.","Harrison D Collier-Bain

immunotherapy,Comparative study of the commonly used protein quantitation assays on different Hymenoptera venoms: A fundamental aspect of Hymenoptera venom proteome analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503352,"Determination of protein concentration in Hymenoptera venoms requires an accurate and reproducible assay as the results will be used to support subsequent proteomic techniques employed in their analyses. However, all protein assay techniques have inherent strengths and weaknesses, demanding their assessment before selecting the most suitable platform for sample analysis. In this study, protein profiles of ant, honeybee, and wasp venoms, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hyaluronidase standards were qualitatively assessed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Their amino acid and protein concentration were quantitatively determined via Amino Acid Analysis (AAA). Amino acid concentration was determined via hydrolysis, derivatization, and chromatographic quantification. Protein concentration was estimated using four different protein concentration assays. The ratios of protein concentration in venom samples to protein standards were calculated, and the accuracy of the protein concentration assays was analysed relative to the concentration determined from AAA. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that BSA contained several protein bands, while hyaluronidase contained a mixture of peptide and protein bands. Ant and honeybee venoms contained a higher proportion of peptide bands, while wasp venom contained more protein bands. As determined by AAA, the ratio of protein concentration in Hymenoptera venoms varied between 1.01 and 1.11 to BSA, and between 0.96 and 1.06 to hyaluronidase. Overall, the Bradford assay was found to be the least accurate and the BCA assay was the most accurate in estimating protein concentration in Hymenoptera venoms. There was no significant advantage in using hyaluronidase as a standard or increasing incubation temperature of BCA assay when analysing Hymenoptera venoms. Diluent solutions containing phenol and human serum albumin interfered with Lowry-based assays.","Troy Wanandy

immunotherapy,Viewing the immune checkpoint VISTA: landscape and outcomes across cancers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503143,"Background:
        
      
      Optimizing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy may require identification of co-targetable checkpoint pathways via immune profiling. Herein, we analyzed the transcriptomic expression and clinical correlates of V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), a promising targetable checkpoint.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      RNA sequencing was carried out on 514 tissues reflecting diverse advanced/metastatic cancers. Expression of eight immune checkpoint markers [lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 14 (TNFRSF14), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)], in addition to VISTA, was analyzed, along with clinical outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      High VISTA RNA expression was observed in 32% of tumors (66/514) and was the most common highly expressed checkpoint among the nine assessed. High VISTA expression was independently correlated with high BTLA, TIM-3, and TNFRSF14, and with a diagnosis of pancreatic, small intestine, and stomach cancer. VISTA transcript levels did not correlate with overall survival (OS) from metastatic/advanced disease in the pan-cancer cohort or with immunotherapy outcome (progression-free survival and OS from the start of ICI) in 217 ICI-treated patients. However, in ICI-treated pancreatic cancer patients (n = 16), median OS was significantly shorter (from immunotherapy initiation) for the high- versus not-high-VISTA groups (0.28 versus 1.21 years) (P = 0.047); in contrast, VISTA levels were not correlated with OS in 36 pancreatic cancer patients who did not receive ICI.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      High VISTA expression correlates with high BTLA, TIM-3, and TNFRSF14 checkpoint-related molecules and with poorer post-immunotherapy survival in pancreatic cancer, consistent with prior literature indicating that VISTA is prominently expressed on CD68+ macrophages in pancreatic cancers and requiring validation in larger prospective studies. Immunomic analysis may be important for individualized precision immunotherapy.","D Nishizaki

immunotherapy,Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinomas With Defective Mismatch Repair: Current Knowledge and Clinical Management.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503041,"Esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas, referred to collectively as gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEAs), are a major cause of global cancer-related mortality. Our increasing molecular understanding has led to the addition of biomarker-directed approaches to defined subgroups and has improved survival in selected patients, such as those with HER2 and Claudin18.2 overexpression. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of cancer, including GEA, but biomarkers beyond PD-L1 expression are lacking. Mismatch repair deficiency and/or high microsatellite instability (dMMR/MSI-H) is observed in 8% to 22% of nonmetastatic GEA, and 3% to 5% of patients with metastatic disease. dMMR/MSI-H tumors are associated with more favorable prognosis and significant benefit from ICIs, although some heterogeneity exists. The activity of ICIs in advanced dMMR/MSI-H cancer is seen across lines of therapy and should be recommended in the frontline setting. In patients with nonmetastatic dMMR/MSI-H cancer, increasing evidence suggests that perioperative and adjuvant chemotherapy may not provide benefit to the dMMR/MSI-H subgroup. The activity of perioperative chemotherapy-free immune checkpoint regimens in patients with nonmetastatic dMMR/MSI-H cancer is highly promising and underscores the need to identify this unique subgroup. We recommend MMR/MSI testing for all patients with GEA at diagnosis, and review the key rationale and clinical management implications for patient with dMMR/MSI-H tumors across disease stages.","Matthew R Strickland

immunotherapy,Imaging-guided prognostic score-based approach to assess the benefits of combotherapy versus monotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic MSI-H colorectal cancer patients.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502988,"Background:
        
      
      This retrospective study determined survival responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), comparing mono- (mono) and combo-immunotherapy (combo) in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) by analyzing quantitative imaging data and clinical factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred fifty patients were included from two centers and divided into training (n = 105) and validation (n = 45) cohorts. Radiologists manually annotated chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography and calculated tumor burden. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed, and variables were selected through Recursive Feature Elimination. Cutoff values were determined using maximally selected rank statistics to binarize features, forming a risk score with hazard ratio-derived weights.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 2258 lesions were annotated with excellent reproducibility. Key variables in the training cohort included: total tumor volume (cutoff: 73 cm3), lesion count (cutoff: 20), age (cutoff: 60) and the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Their respective weights were 1.13, 0.96, 0.91, and 0.38, resulting in a risk score cutoff of 1.36. Low-score patients showed similar overall survival and PFS regardless of treatment, while those with a high-score had significantly worse survivals with mono vs combo (P = 0.004 and P = 0.0001). In the validation set, low-score patients exhibited no significant difference in overall survival and PFS with mono or combo. However, patients with a high-score had worse PFS with mono (P = 0.046).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A score based on total tumor volume, lesion count, the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, and age can guide MSI-H mCRC treatment decisions, allowing oncologists to identify suitable candidates for mono and combo ICI therapies.","Rémy Barbe

immunotherapy,"Real-world use, dose intensity, and adherence to enfortumab vedotin in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503592,"Background:
        
      
      Enfortumab vedotin (EV) monotherapy is approved for the treatment of advanced urothelial cancer as later-line therapy (post-immunotherapy and -platinum-chemotherapy) and as earlier-line therapy (cisplatin-ineligible, at least 1 prior therapy). We examined real-world EV monotherapy use, dose intensity and adherence across 280 US cancer clinics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This postmarketing study used data from a nationwide (United States) deidentified patient-level electronic health record-derived database. Included were patients with advanced urothelial cancer initiating EV on or after December 19, 2019 (date of accelerated approval). We summarized characteristics of EV users using descriptive statistics and computed metrics of EV use, EV dose intensity, and EV treatment adherence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 416 advanced urothelial cancer patients initiating EV monotherapy. More than half of patients (55.3%) received EV as later-line therapy (3L+), and nearly half (44.7%) received EV as earlier line therapy (1 or 2L). Dosing frequency (mean [SD] 2.4 [0.5] treatments per 28 day cycle) and dose (1.1 [0.2] mg/kg) were lower than label indication guidelines (1.25 mg/kg, Day 1, 8, 15 of a 28 day cycle). Only 58.8% of patients received an average of >2 treatments per 28-day cycle.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients with advanced urothelial cancer treated with EV monotherapy in contemporary practice, EV dosing frequency, and dosage was lower in clinical practice than recommended in the product labeling. Further research is required to understand clinical factors and outcomes associated with the differences observed.","Ronac Mamtani

immunotherapy,"Durvalumab and tremelimumab before surgery in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative stage II-III breast cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502947,"A clinical trial was conducted to assess the feasibility of enrolling patients with Stage II or III hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2-negative breast cancer to pre-operative dual PD-L1/CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibition administered prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Eight eligible patients were treated with upfront durvalumab and tremelimumab for two cycles. Patients then received NACT prior to breast surgery. Seven patients had baseline and interval breast ultrasounds after combination immunotherapy and the responses were mixed: 3/7 patients experienced a ≥30% decrease in tumor volume, 3/7 a ≥30% increase, and 1 patient had stable disease. At the time of breast surgery, 1/8 patients had a pathologic complete response (pCR). The trial was stopped early after 3 of 8 patients experienced immunotherapy-related toxicity or suspected disease progression that prompted discontinuation or a delay in the administration of NACT. Two patients experienced grade 3 immune-related adverse events (1 with colitis, 1 with endocrinopathy). Analysis of the tumor microenvironment after combination immunotherapy did not show a significant change in immune cell subsets from baseline. There was limited benefit for dual checkpoint blockade administered prior to NACT in our study of 8 patients with HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer.","Haven R Garber

immunotherapy,Computational insights into dynamics and conformational stability of N-acetylmannosamine kinase mutations.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502682,"The activity of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (GNE) is essential for the biosynthesis of sialic acid, which is involved in cellular processes in health and diseases. GNE contains an N-terminal epimerase domain and a C-terminal kinase domain (N-acetylmannosamine kinase, MNK). Mutations of the GNE protein led to hypoactivity of the enzyme and cause sialurea or autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy/Nonaka myopathy. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to comprehend the folding, dynamics and conformational stability of MNK variants, including the wild type (WT) and three mutants (H677R, V696M and H677R/V696M). The deleterious and destabilizing nature of MNK mutants were predicted using different prediction tools. Results predicted that mutations modulate the stability, flexibility and function of MNK. The effect of mutations on the conformational stability and dynamics of MNK was next studied through the free-energy landscape (FEL), hydrogen-bonds and secondary structure changes. The FEL results show that the mutations interfere with various conformational transitions in both WT and mutants, exposing the structural underpinnings of protein destabilization and unfolding brought on by mutation. We discover that, when compared to the other two mutations, V696M and H677R/V696M, H677R has the most harmful effects. These findings have a strong correlation with published experimental studies that demonstrate how these mutations disrupt MNK activity. Hence, this computational study describes the structural details to unravel the mutant effects at the atomistic resolution and has implications for understanding the GNE's physiological and pathological role.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

immunotherapy,Senescent T Cells in Age-Related Diseases.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502582,"Age-induced alterations in human immunity are often considered deleterious and are referred to as immunosenescence. The immune system monitors the number of senescent cells in the body, while immunosenescence may represent the initiation of systemic aging. Immune cells, particularly T cells, are the most impacted and involved in age-related immune function deterioration, making older individuals more prone to different age-related diseases. T-cell senescence can impact the effectiveness of immunotherapies that rely on the immune system's function, including vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies. The research and practice of using senescent T cells as therapeutic targets to intervene in age-related diseases are in their nascent stages. Therefore, in this review, we summarize recent related literature to investigate the characteristics of senescent T cells as well as their formation mechanisms, relationship with various aging-related diseases, and means of intervention. The primary objective of this article is to explore the prospects and possibilities of therapeutically targeting senescent T cells, serving as a valuable resource for the development of immunotherapy and treatment of age-related diseases.","Pei-Jie Yu, Mei Zhou, Yan Liu, Jie Du; Pei-Jie Yu, Mei Zhou, Yan Liu, Jie Du",,,2024 Mar 8.
radiology,Incidence and predictors of restenosis following successful recanalization of non-acute internal carotid artery occlusion in 252 cases.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503511,"Background:
        
      
      Data concerning restenosis following successful recanalization of non-acute internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) are scarce. This study was conducted to identify the incidence and predictors of restenosis following successful recanalization of non-acute ICAO.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed the incidence of restenosis (defined as >70% restenosis or reocclusion) among 252 consecutive patients with successful recanalization of non-acute ICAO. Baseline, imaging, and surgery-related characteristics were analyzed to assess their association with restenosis. A scoring system was developed to identify high-risk patients for restenosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During a median follow-up of 12.6 months, restenosis occurred in 56 patients (22.2%), including 39 with reocclusion and 17 with >70% restenosis. The cumulative restenosis rate was 18.0% at 12 months and 24.1% at 24 months. The incidence of stroke was higher in patients with restenosis (25.0% vs 1.5%, P<0.01). Multivariate analysis showed occlusion length (5-10 cm vs <5 cm (hazard ratio (HR) 3.15, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.07 to 9.29); ≥ 10 cm vs <5 cm (HR 5.01, 95% CI 1.73 to 14.49)), residual stenosis ≥30% (HR 3.08, 95% CI 1.79 to 5.30), and internal carotid artery (ICA) wall collapse (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.44) as independent predictors of restenosis. Point scores proportional to model coefficients were assigned, with scores ranging from 0 to 6. Patients scoring 3-6 had a 4.00 times higher chance of developing restenosis (95% CI 2.35 to 6.79) compared with those scoring 0-2.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Nearly one in five patients experienced restenosis following successful recanalization of non-acute ICAO. Occlusion length, residual stenosis ≥30%, and ICA wall collapse were independently associated with restenosis.","Guangdong Lu #

radiology,Adjuvant Wilms' tumour 1-specific dendritic cell immunotherapy complementing conventional therapy for paediatric patients with high-grade glioma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma: protocol of a monocentric phase I/II clinical trial in Belgium.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503417,"Introduction:
        
      
      Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and paediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) are aggressive glial tumours, for which conventional treatment modalities fall short. Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is being investigated as a promising and safe adjuvant therapy. The Wilms' tumour protein (WT1) is a potent target for this type of antigen-specific immunotherapy and is overexpressed in DIPG and pHGG. Based on this, we designed a non-randomised phase I/II trial, assessing the feasibility and safety of WT1 mRNA-loaded DC (WT1/DC) immunotherapy in combination with conventional treatment in pHGG and DIPG.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      10 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed or pretreated HGG or DIPG were treated according to the trial protocol. The trial protocol consists of leukapheresis of mononuclear cells, the manufacturing of autologous WT1/DC vaccines and the combination of WT1/DC-vaccine immunotherapy with conventional antiglioma treatment. In newly diagnosed patients, this comprises chemoradiation (oral temozolomide 90 mg/m2 daily+radiotherapy 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions) followed by three induction WT1/DC vaccines (8-10×106 cells/vaccine) given on a weekly basis and a chemoimmunotherapy booster phase consisting of six 28-day cycles of oral temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2 on days 1-5) and a WT1/DC vaccine on day 21. In pretreated patients, the induction and booster phase are combined with best possible antiglioma treatment at hand. Primary objectives are to assess the feasibility of the production of mRNA-electroporated WT1/DC vaccines in this patient population and to assess the safety and feasibility of combining conventional antiglioma treatment with the proposed immunotherapy. Secondary objectives are to investigate in vivo immunogenicity of WT1/DC vaccination and to assess disease-specific and general quality of life.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      The ethics committee of the Antwerp University Hospital and the University of Antwerp granted ethics approval. Results of the clinical trial will be shared through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentations at conferences.

radiology,Radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma guided by real-time physics-based ablation simulation: a prospective study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503326,"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) guidance software that incorporated patient-specific physics-based simulation of each ablation volume.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Patients referred for curative ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of 2-5 cm diameter were prospectively enrolled. RFA was performed under general anesthesia. Procedure planning and intraprocedural modifications were guided by computer simulation of each ablation. The segmented target (tumor with 5 mm margin) was registered to and superimposed on subsequent 3D multiplanar images. The applied RF energy was used to calculate a simulated ablation volume which was displayed relative to the electrode and segmented target, to depict any untreated target tissue. After each additional ablation, the software updated the accumulated simulated ablation volume in relation to the target. The primary endpoints were technical efficacy and rate of local tumor progression (LTP).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-eight tumors were ablated during 57 procedures in 52 patients (68.3 ± 9.2 years old, 78.8% male); 15 (26.3%) had multiple lesions and 23 (39.1%) had prior HCC treatment. The mean tumor diameter was 2.73 (±0.64) cm. The intraprocedural simulation directed additional overlapping ablations in 75.9% of tumors. Technical success and efficacy were 100% at 3-month contrast enhanced CT or MRI follow-up after the single treatment session. Cumulative incidence function estimates for 1- and 2-year LTP were 3.9% and 20.2%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This prospective study found computer-assisted guidance that simulated each ablation was both safe and efficacious. The low rate of LTP was similar to studies that employed stereotactic guidance and ablation confirmation, without requiring a second contrast enhanced study.","Eric K Hoffer

radiology,The Relationship of Gastrocnemius-Soleus Muscle Architecture with Balance and Functional Strength in Acute Stroke Patients.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503319,"Balance and functional impairment could occur due to the weakness of the gastrocsoleus muscles in acute stroke patients. This study was planned to determine the muscle architecture and its relationship to balance and functional strength functional ability in patients with acute stroke. A cross-sectional analysis of 22 stroke patients (68.59 ± 8.16) was performed in this study. Gastrocnemius muscle thickness and cross-sectional area were significantly greater on the non-paretic than on the paretic sides (p = 0.004, p = 0.005, respectively). Partial correlation analysis showed that soleus muscle thickness and cross-sectional area was significantly correlated with Berg Balance Scale, Single Leg Stance Test, Five Times Sit to Stand Test and Tandem test results in the paretic side (r = 0.49-0.77, p < 0.05). The gastrocnemius muscle thickness of the non-paretic side had a significant relationship with balance (r = 0.45-0.65, p < 0.05). The muscle thickness and cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle on the paretic sides was significantly related with the functional strength and balance after stroke. It may be beneficial to develop clinical assessment and intervention programs focusing on distal plantar flexor muscle groups in order to improve the functional status and balance.","Hatice Yakut

radiology,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy neurobiology in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder: A domain-related resting-state networks approach.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38503084,"Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) stands out as a promising augmentation psychological therapy for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To identify potential predictive and response biomarkers, this study examines the relationship between clinical domains and resting-state network connectivity in OCD patients undergoing a 3-month MBCT programme. Twelve OCD patients underwent two resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions at baseline and after the MBCT programme. We assessed four clinical domains: positive affect, negative affect, anxiety sensitivity, and rumination. Independent component analysis characterised resting-state networks (RSNs), and multiple regression analyses evaluated brain-clinical associations. At baseline, distinct network connectivity patterns were found for each clinical domain: parietal-subcortical, lateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, and frontal-occipital. Predictive and response biomarkers revealed significant brain-clinical associations within two main RSNs: the ventral default mode network (vDMN) and the frontostriatal network (FSN). Key brain nodes -the precuneus and the frontopolar cortex- were identified within these networks. MBCT may modulate vDMN and FSN connectivity in OCD patients, possibly reducing symptoms across clinical domains. Each clinical domain had a unique baseline brain connectivity pattern, suggesting potential symptom-based biomarkers. Using these RSNs as predictors could enable personalised treatments and the identification of patients who would benefit most from MBCT.","Víctor De la Peña-Arteaga

radiology,Imaging-guided prognostic score-based approach to assess the benefits of combotherapy versus monotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic MSI-H colorectal cancer patients.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502988,"Background:
        
      
      This retrospective study determined survival responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), comparing mono- (mono) and combo-immunotherapy (combo) in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) by analyzing quantitative imaging data and clinical factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred fifty patients were included from two centers and divided into training (n = 105) and validation (n = 45) cohorts. Radiologists manually annotated chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography and calculated tumor burden. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed, and variables were selected through Recursive Feature Elimination. Cutoff values were determined using maximally selected rank statistics to binarize features, forming a risk score with hazard ratio-derived weights.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 2258 lesions were annotated with excellent reproducibility. Key variables in the training cohort included: total tumor volume (cutoff: 73 cm3), lesion count (cutoff: 20), age (cutoff: 60) and the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Their respective weights were 1.13, 0.96, 0.91, and 0.38, resulting in a risk score cutoff of 1.36. Low-score patients showed similar overall survival and PFS regardless of treatment, while those with a high-score had significantly worse survivals with mono vs combo (P = 0.004 and P = 0.0001). In the validation set, low-score patients exhibited no significant difference in overall survival and PFS with mono or combo. However, patients with a high-score had worse PFS with mono (P = 0.046).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A score based on total tumor volume, lesion count, the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, and age can guide MSI-H mCRC treatment decisions, allowing oncologists to identify suitable candidates for mono and combo ICI therapies.","Rémy Barbe

radiology,Artificial intelligence system for automatic maxillary sinus segmentation on cone beam computed tomography images.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502963,"Objectives:
        
      
      The study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on nnU-Net v2 for automatic maxillary sinus (MS) segmentation in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) volumes and to evaluate the performance of this model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In 101 CBCT scans, MS were annotated using the CranioCatch labelling software (Eskisehir, Turkey) The dataset was divided into three parts: 80 CBCT scans for training the model, 11 CBCT scans for model validation, and 10 CBCT scans for testing the model. The model training was conducted using the nnU-Net v2 deep learning model with a learning rate of 0.00001 for 1000 epochs. The performance of the model to automatically segment the MS on CBCT scans was assessed by several parameters, including F1-score, accuracy, sensitivity, precision, Area Under Curve (AUC), Dice Coefficient (DC), 95% Hausdorff Distance (95% HD), and Intersection over Union (IoU) values.
    


          Results:
        
      
      F1-score, accuracy, sensitivity, precision values were found to be 0.96, 0.99, 0.96, 0.96 respectively for the successful segmentation of maxillary sinus in CBCT images. AUC, DC, 95% HD, IoU values were 0.97, 0.96, 1.19, 0.93, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Models based on nnU-Net v2 demonstrate the ability to segment the MS autonomously and accurately in CBCT images.","Ibrahim Sevki Bayrakdar
