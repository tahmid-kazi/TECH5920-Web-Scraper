cancer,Global Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates and Trends--An Update.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26667886,"There are limited published data on recent cancer incidence and mortality trends worldwide. We used the International Agency for Research on Cancer's CANCERMondial clearinghouse to present age-standardized cancer incidence and death rates for 2003-2007. We also present trends in incidence through 2007 and mortality through 2012 for select countries from five continents. High-income countries (HIC) continue to have the highest incidence rates for all sites, as well as for lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, although some low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) now count among those with the highest rates. Mortality rates from these cancers are declining in many HICs while they are increasing in LMICs. LMICs have the highest rates of stomach, liver, esophageal, and cervical cancer. Although rates remain high in HICs, they are plateauing or decreasing for the most common cancers due to decreases in known risk factors, screening and early detection, and improved treatment (mortality only). In contrast, rates in several LMICs are increasing for these cancers due to increases in smoking, excess body weight, and physical inactivity. LMICs also have a disproportionate burden of infection-related cancers. Applied cancer control measures are needed to reduce rates in HICs and arrest the growing burden in LMICs."
cancer,Cancer and cure: A critical analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28244479,"Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of the 20th century and spreading further with continuance and increasing incidence in the 21st century. The situation is so alarming that every fourth person is having a lifetime risk of cancer. India registers more than 11 lakh new cases of cancer every year, whereas, this figure is above 14 million worldwide. Is cancer curable? The short answer to this question is ""Yes."" In fact, all cancers are curable if they are caught early enough. Cancer cells continue to grow unless one of four things occur: (1) The cancerous mass is removed surgically; (2) using chemotherapy or another type of cancer-specific medication, such as hormonal therapy; (3) using radiation therapy; or (4) the cancer cells shrink and disappear on their own."
cancer,Measuring cancer evolution from the genome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27741350,"The temporal dynamics of cancer evolution remain elusive, because it is impractical to longitudinally observe cancers unperturbed by treatment. Consequently, our knowledge of how cancers grow largely derives from inferences made from a single point in time - the endpoint in the cancer's evolution, when it is removed from the body and studied in the laboratory. Fortuitously however, the cancer genome, by virtue of ongoing mutations that uniquely mark clonal lineages within the tumour, provides a rich, yet surreptitious, record of cancer development. In this review, we describe how a cancer's genome can be analysed to reveal the temporal history of mutation and selection, and discuss why both selective and neutral evolution feature prominently in carcinogenesis. We argue that selection in cancer can only be properly studied once we have some understanding of what the absence of selection looks like. We review the data describing punctuated evolution in cancer, and reason that punctuated phenotype evolution is consistent with both gradual and punctuated genome evolution. We conclude that, to map and predict evolutionary trajectories during carcinogenesis, it is critical to better understand the relationship between genotype change and phenotype change.

cancer,The Role of Telomerase in Breast Cancer's Response to Therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36361634,"Currently, breast cancer appears to be the most widespread cancer in the world and the most common cause of cancer deaths. This specific type of cancer affects women in both developed and developing countries. Prevention and early diagnosis are very important factors for good prognosis. A characteristic feature of cancer cells is the ability of unlimited cell division, which makes them immortal. Telomeres, which are shortened with each cell division in normal cells, are rebuilt in cancer cells by the enzyme telomerase, which is expressed in more than 85% of cancers (up to 100% of adenocarcinomas, including breast cancer). Telomerase may have different functions that are related to telomeres or unrelated. It has been shown that high activity of the enzyme in cancer cells is associated with poor cell sensitivity to therapies. Therefore, telomerase has become a potential target for cancer therapies. The low efficacy of therapies has resulted in the search for new combined and more effective therapeutic methods, including the involvement of telomerase inhibitors and telomerase-targeted immunotherapy."
cancer,Recent Updates on the Relationship between Cancer and Autoimmune Pancreatitis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30713326,"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is now considered a pancreatic manifestation of a newly proposed disease condition, IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IgG4-RD is characterized by enhanced IgG4 antibody responses and multiple organ involvements. Recent epidemiological studies have addressed the incidence of cancer in patients with AIP and/or IgG4-RD. Surprisingly, a significant number of AIP patients were detected with cancer at or within one year of the diagnosis of AIP. Furthermore, around 50% of all cancers detected in AIP patients comprised mainly 3 types (gastric, lung, and prostate cancer). Thus, AIP appears to be associated with cancer of other organs rather than the pancreas itself, which suggests that AIP is not a pre-cancerous condition of the pancreas. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of cancer and AIP in many patients has led to the establishment of an attractive concept that AIP might sometimes arise from co-existing cancers as a paraneoplastic syndrome."
cancer,Field cancerization in breast cancer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35362092,"Breast cancer affects one in seven women worldwide during their lifetime. Widespread mammographic screening programs and education campaigns allow for early detection of the disease, often during its asymptomatic phase. Current practice in treatment and recurrence monitoring is based primarily on pathological evaluations but can also encompass genomic evaluations, both of which focus on the primary tumor. Although breast cancer is one of the most studied cancers, patients still recur at a rate of up to 15% within the first 10 years post-surgery. Local recurrence was originally attributed to tumor cells contaminating histologically normal (HN) tissues beyond the surgical margin, but advances in technology have allowed for the identification of distinct aberrations that exist in the peri-tumoral tissues themselves. One leading theory to explain this phenomenon is the field cancerization theory. Under this hypothesis, tumors arise from a field of molecularly altered cells that create a permissive environment for malignant evolution, which can occur with or without morphological changes. The traditional histopathology paradigm dictates that molecular alterations are reflected in the tissue phenotype. However, the spectrum of inter-patient variability of normal breast tissue may obfuscate recognition of a cancerized field during routine diagnostics. In this review, we explore the concept of field cancerization focusing on HN peri-tumoral tissues: we present the pathological and molecular features of field cancerization within these tissues and discuss how the use of peri-tumoral tissues can affect research. Our observations suggest that pathological and molecular evaluations could be used synergistically to assess risk and guide the therapeutic management of patients. © 2022 The Authors.

cancer,Tumor microenvironment: recent advances in various cancer treatments.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29949179,"This is a review regarding different types of cancer treatments. We aimed at analyzing the tumor microenvironment and the recent trends for the therapeutic applications and effectiveness for several kinds of cancers. Traditionally the cancer treatment was based on the neoplastic cells. Methods such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, which were targeted on the highly proliferating mutated tumor cells, have been investigated. The tumor microenvironment describes the non-cancerous cells in the tumor and has enabled to investigate the behavior and response of the cancer cells to a treatment process; it consists in a tissue that may have a predictive significance for tumor behavior and response to therapy. These include fibroblasts, immune cells and cells that comprise the blood vessels. It also includes the proteins produced by all of the cells present in the tumor that support the growth of the cancer cells. By monitoring changes in the tumor microenvironment using its molecular and cellular profiles as the tumor progresses will be vital for identifying cell or protein targets for the cancer prevention and its therapeutic purposes."
cancer,What Is Cancer?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31761807,"This essay focuses on themes in Explaining Cancer: Finding Order in Disorder (2018) by Anya Plutynski, a monograph that has important things to say about both the peculiarities of cancers and our theories about them. Cancer's agents of destruction are human cells that have been recruited and to some extent transformed into pathological organisms or the building blocks of tumors. Cancers both undermine and exploit mechanisms of multicellular organization, and understanding them gives rise to difficult philosophical problems. In addition to sketching Plutynski's discussion of these problems, this essay defends Christopher Boorse's account of disease from Plutynski's criticisms, and it expresses some qualms about her treatment of scientific explanation."
cancer,New methods in the diagnosis of cancer and gene therapy of cancer based on nanoparticles.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28574057,"Cancer is one of the leading cause of death in the world with the prevalence of >10 million mortalities annually. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation, and taking chemotherapeutic drugs, which often kill the healthy cells and result in toxicity in patients. Therefore, researchers are looking for ways to be able to eliminate just cancerous cells. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of cancerous cells is the main obstacle on the way of an effective cancer treatment. However, better comprehension of molecular basis of tumor and the advent of new diagnostic technologies can help to improve the treatment of various cancers. Therefore, study of epigenetic changes, gene expression of cancerous cells and employing methods that enable us to correct or minimize these changes is critically important. In this paper, we will review the recent advanced strategies being used in the field of cancer research."
