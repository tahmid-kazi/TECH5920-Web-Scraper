oncology,"Associations Between Stress, Health Behaviors, and Quality of Life in Young Couples During the Transition to Survivorship: Protocol for a Measurement Burst Study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652520,"Background:
        
      
      Cancer is a life-threatening, stressful event, particularly for young adults due to delays and disruptions in their developmental transitions. Cancer treatment can also cause adverse long-term effects, chronic conditions, psychological issues, and decreased quality of life (QoL) among young adults. Despite numerous health benefits of health behaviors (eg, physical activity, healthy eating, no smoking, no alcohol use, and quality sleep), young adult cancer survivors report poor health behavior profiles. Determining the associations of stress (either cancer-specific or day-to-day stress), health behaviors, and QoL as young adult survivors transition to survivorship is key to understanding and enhancing these survivors' health. It is also crucial to note that the effects of stress on health behaviors and QoL may manifest on a shorter time scale (eg, daily within-person level). Moreover, given that stress spills over into romantic relationships, it is important to identify the role of spouses or partners (hereafter partners) in these survivors' health behaviors and QoL.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to investigate associations between stress, health behaviors, and QoL at both within- and between-person levels during the transition to survivorship in young adult cancer survivors and their partners, to identify the extent to which young adult survivors' and their partners' stress facilitates or hinders their own and each other's health behaviors and QoL.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We aim to enroll 150 young adults (aged 25-39 years at the time of cancer diagnosis) who have recently completed cancer treatment, along with their partners. We will conduct a prospective longitudinal study using a measurement burst design. Participants (ie, survivors and their partners) will complete a daily web-based survey for 7 consecutive days (a ""burst"") 9 times over 2 years, with the bursts spaced 3 months apart. Participants will self-report their stress, health behaviors, and QoL. Additionally, participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer to assess their physical activity and sleep during the burst period. Finally, dietary intake (24-hour diet recalls) will be assessed during each burst via telephone by research staff.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participant enrollment began in January 2022. Recruitment and data collection are expected to conclude by December 2024 and December 2026, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study that determines the interdependence of health behaviors and QoL of young adult cancer survivors and their partners at both within- and between-person levels. This study is unique in its focus on the transition to cancer survivorship and its use of a measurement burst design. Results will guide the creation of a developmentally appropriate dyadic psychosocial or behavioral intervention that improves both young adult survivors' and their partners' health behaviors and QoL and potentially their physical health.

oncology,Is a low dose of dexamethasone sufficient to prevent paclitaxel-related hypersensitivity reactions? A retrospective study in patients with gynecologic malignancy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652518,"Background:
        
      
      Paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) are prevalent, especially in females. The common paclitaxel pretreatment, dexamethasone, may inhibit chemotherapy efficacy and accelerate tumor progression. We aimed to balance paclitaxel HSRs and the lowest dexamethasone dose for gynecologic malignancies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively examined 1,074 cycles of 3-weekly paclitaxel-containing treatment for 231 gynecologic malignancies at Xiangya Hospital. HSR incidence with different dexamethasone regimens was the primary outcome. Risk factors were examined in all cycles using univariate and multivariate models with generalized estimating equations. A subgroup analysis of initial exposure to paclitaxel was also conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      HSR occurred in 33 patients (14.29%) and 49 cycles (4.56%), including 69.39% in cycles 1-2. There were no severe HSRs (grade ≥3). Different premedication regimens, including dexamethasone dosage and route, ranitidine presence or absence, didn't affect HSR incidence in univariate and multivariate analyzes (p > 0.05). Premenopausal women exerted fewer HSRs (ORadj 0.22, 95%CI 0.08-0.58; p = 0.002). At the first exposure to paclitaxel, more than 10 mg of dexamethasone didn't diminish HSRs (OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.27-2.59; p = 0.753).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In gynecologic malignancies, 10 mg dexamethasone along with 20 mg diphenhydramine may be adequate to prevent paclitaxel HSRs without ranitidine. It is necessary to reevaluate paclitaxel premedication regimens.","Affiliations

oncology,CDH1 Genotype Exploration in Women With Hereditary Lobular Breast Cancer Phenotype.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652475,"Importance:
        
      
      Pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline CDH1 variants are associated with risk for diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer (LBC) in the so-called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome. However, in some circumstances, LBC can be the first manifestation of this syndrome in the absence of diffuse gastric cancer manifestation.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate the frequency of germline CDH1 variants in women with the hereditary LBC (HLBC) phenotype, somatic CDH1 gene inactivation in germline CDH1 variant carriers' tumor samples, and the association of genetic profiles with clinical-pathological data and survival.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This single-center, longitudinal, prospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2021, with follow-up until January 31, 2023. Women with LBC seen at the European Institute of Oncology were included. Testing for germline CDH1, BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes was performed. Somatic profiling was assessed for germline CDH1 carriers.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Accurate estimates of prevalence of germline CDH1 variants among patients with HLBC and the association of somatic sequence alteration with HLBC syndrome. The Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model were applied for overall and disease-free survival analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 5429 cases of primary LBC, familial LBC phenotype accounted for 1867 (34.4%). A total of 394 women with LBC were tested, among whom 15 germline CDH1 variants in 15 unrelated families were identified. Among these variants, 6 (40.0%) were P/LP, with an overall frequency of 1.5% (6 of 394). Of the 6 probands with P/LP CDH1 LBC, 5 (83.3%) had a positive family history of BC and only 1 (16.7%) had sporadic juvenile early-onset LBC. No germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants were identified in CDH1 carriers. An inactivating CDH1 mechanism (second hit) was identified in 4 of 6 explored matched tumor samples (66.7%) in P/LP germline carriers. The P/LP CDH1 LBC variant carriers had a significantly lower age at diagnosis compared with the group carrying CDH1 variants of unknown significance or likely benign (42.5 [IQR, 38.3-43.0] vs 51.0 [IQR, 45.0-53.0] years; P = .03).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this cohort study, P/LP germline CDH1 variants were identified in individuals not fulfilling the classic clinical criteria for HDGC screening, suggesting that identification of these variants may provide a novel method to test women with LBC with early age at diagnosis and/or positive family history of BC.","Affiliations

oncology,Telemedicine in geriatric oncology - lessons learned from the COVID-19 experience.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652459,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Telemedicine quickly became integrated into healthcare caused by the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Rapid use of telemedicine into healthcare systems was supported by the World Health Organization and other prominent national organizations to reduce transmission of the virus while continuing to provide access to care. In this review, we explored the effect of this swift change in care and its impact on older adults with cancer.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Older adults are susceptible to the COVID-19 virus caused by various risk factors, such as comorbidity, frailty, decreased immunity, and cancer increases vulnerability to infection, hospitalization, and mortality. We found three major themes emerged in the literature published in the past 18 months, including access to care, telemedicine modes of communication, and the use of technology by older adults with cancer. These findings have brought insight into issues regarding healthcare disparities.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The utilization of telemedicine by older adults with cancer has potential future benefits with the integration of technology preparation prior to the patient's initial visit and addressing known health disparities. The hybrid model of care provides in-person and or remote access to clinicians which may allow older adults with cancer the flexibility needed to obtain quality cancer care.","Affiliation

oncology,Role of mucositis in predicting gut microbiota composition in people with cancer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652454,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Disruption of the precious ecosystem of micro-organisms that reside in the gut - the gut microbiota - is rapidly emerging as a key driver of adverse side effects/toxicities caused by numerous anti-cancer agents. Although the contribution of the gut microbiota to these toxicities is understood with ever increasing precision, the cause of microbial disruption (dysbiosis) remains poorly understood. Here, we discuss current evidence on the cause(s) of dysbiosis after cancer therapy, positioning breakdown of the intestinal mucosa (mucositis) as a central cause.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Dysbiosis in people with cancer has historically been attributed to extensive antibiotic use. However, evidence now suggests that certain antibiotics have minimal impacts on the microbiota. Indeed, recent evidence shows that the type of cancer therapy used predicts microbiota composition independently of antibiotics. Given most anti-cancer drugs have modest effects on microbes directly, this suggests that their impact on the gut microenvironment, in particular the mucosa, which is highly vulnerable to cytotoxicity, is a likely cause of dysbiosis. Here, we outline evidence that support this hypothesis, and discuss the associated clinical implications/opportunities.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The concept that mucositis dictates microbiota compositions provides two important implications for clinical practice. Firstly, it reiterates the importance of prioritising the development of novel mucoprotectants that preserve mucosal integrity, and indirectly support microbial stability. Secondly, it provides an opportunity to identify dysbiotic events and associated consequences using readily accessible, minimally invasive biomarkers of mucositis such as plasma citrulline.","Affiliations

oncology,Antibody Drug Conjugates in Urological Cancers: A Review of the Current Landscape.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652426,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Our review delves into the progress across urological malignancies and discusses ongoing challenges and future directions in antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) development, emphasising their transformative potential in cancer care.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      ADCs have advanced from hematologic to solid tumours, notably in breast cancer, and are now pivotal in metastatic urological cancers as both monotherapies and in combination regimens, underscored by the FDA's approval of enfortumab vedotin and sacituzumab govitecan for metastatic urothelial cancer. Progress in metastatic prostate cancer, particularly with ADCs targeting PSMA and STEAP1, is noteworthy, although renal cell cancer presents ongoing challenges. There is a continual search for agents in the metastatic, relapsed testicular cancer landscape. ADCs have emerged as a pivotal innovation in oncology, blending targeted antibody therapy with potent cytotoxic drugs, significantly advancing treatment options for urological malignancies.","Affiliations

oncology,Navigating Breast Cancer Oligometastasis and Oligoprogression: Current Landscape and Future Directions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652425,"Purpose:
        
      
      We examine the potential for curative approaches among metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients by exploring the recent literature on local ablative therapies like surgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with oligometastatic (OM) breast cancer. We also cover therapies for MBC patients with oligoprogressive (OP) disease.
    


          Key findings:
        
      
      Surgery and SBRT have been studied for OM and OP breast cancer, mainly in retrospective or non-randomized trials. While many studies demonstrated favorable results, a cooperative study and single-institution trial found no support for surgery/SBRT in OM and OP cases, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      While there is interest in applying local therapies to OM and OP breast cancer, the current randomized data does not back the routine use of surgery or SBRT, particularly when considering the potential for treatment-related toxicities. Future research should refine patient selection through advanced imaging and possibly explore these therapies specifically in patients with hormone receptor-positive or HER2-positive disease.","Affiliations

      This article aims to describe the ways in which digital health technologies are currently being used to improve the delivery of cancer care, highlight opportunities to expand their use, and discuss barriers to effective and equitable implementation.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      The utilization of digital health tools and development of novel care delivery models that leverage such tools is expanding. Recent studies have shown feasibility and increased implementation in the setting of oncologic care. With technological advances and key policy changes, utilization of digital health tools has greatly increased over the past two decades and transformed how cancer care is delivered. As digital health tools are expanded and refined, there is potential for improved access to and quality and efficiency of cancer care. However, careful consideration should be given to key barriers of digital health tool adoption, such as infrastructural, patient-level, and health systems-level challenges, to ensure equitable access to care and improvement in health outcomes.","Affiliations

lymphoma,"Associations Between Stress, Health Behaviors, and Quality of Life in Young Couples During the Transition to Survivorship: Protocol for a Measurement Burst Study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652520,"Background:
        
      
      Cancer is a life-threatening, stressful event, particularly for young adults due to delays and disruptions in their developmental transitions. Cancer treatment can also cause adverse long-term effects, chronic conditions, psychological issues, and decreased quality of life (QoL) among young adults. Despite numerous health benefits of health behaviors (eg, physical activity, healthy eating, no smoking, no alcohol use, and quality sleep), young adult cancer survivors report poor health behavior profiles. Determining the associations of stress (either cancer-specific or day-to-day stress), health behaviors, and QoL as young adult survivors transition to survivorship is key to understanding and enhancing these survivors' health. It is also crucial to note that the effects of stress on health behaviors and QoL may manifest on a shorter time scale (eg, daily within-person level). Moreover, given that stress spills over into romantic relationships, it is important to identify the role of spouses or partners (hereafter partners) in these survivors' health behaviors and QoL.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to investigate associations between stress, health behaviors, and QoL at both within- and between-person levels during the transition to survivorship in young adult cancer survivors and their partners, to identify the extent to which young adult survivors' and their partners' stress facilitates or hinders their own and each other's health behaviors and QoL.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We aim to enroll 150 young adults (aged 25-39 years at the time of cancer diagnosis) who have recently completed cancer treatment, along with their partners. We will conduct a prospective longitudinal study using a measurement burst design. Participants (ie, survivors and their partners) will complete a daily web-based survey for 7 consecutive days (a ""burst"") 9 times over 2 years, with the bursts spaced 3 months apart. Participants will self-report their stress, health behaviors, and QoL. Additionally, participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer to assess their physical activity and sleep during the burst period. Finally, dietary intake (24-hour diet recalls) will be assessed during each burst via telephone by research staff.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participant enrollment began in January 2022. Recruitment and data collection are expected to conclude by December 2024 and December 2026, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study that determines the interdependence of health behaviors and QoL of young adult cancer survivors and their partners at both within- and between-person levels. This study is unique in its focus on the transition to cancer survivorship and its use of a measurement burst design. Results will guide the creation of a developmentally appropriate dyadic psychosocial or behavioral intervention that improves both young adult survivors' and their partners' health behaviors and QoL and potentially their physical health.

lymphoma,Supportive care measures for bispecific T-cell engager therapies in haematological malignancies.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652455,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Bispecific T-cell engager (TCE) therapies are revolutionizing the treatment of several haematological malignancies, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, various subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Due to their unique mode of action in activating endogenous T cells, they are associated with several important early side effects, including cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, as well as target-specific toxicities and a significant risk of infection.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Currently, supportive care measures for TCEs have largely been inferred from other T-cell therapies, such as CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor) therapy. Further research into TCE-specific supportive care measures is needed to improve the tolerability of these therapies for patients. A key question moving forward is understanding how to predict and minimize early toxicity (cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome). Associated infection risk is a significant cause of patient morbidity, therefore a better understanding of how to optimize TCE-dosing and prophylactic measures, such as intravenous immunoglobulin and antimicrobials, will be crucial to achieving an improved balance of toxicity and efficacy. Enabling early outpatient delivery of these therapies to select patients at lower risk of toxicity may also help to improve patient experience and quality of life.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Here we review up-to-date guidance and literature on existing supportive care measures for bispecific TCE therapy-related toxicities. We highlight both unique and serious side effects of TCE therapies that require improved management strategies to enable more patients to benefit from these efficacious drugs.","Affiliations

In 2019, Spielmann et al. identified two types of anti-Ku syndrome based on a hierarchical clustering analysis. Sjögren's syndrome occurs both in the first type of anti-Ku syndrome and in the second type. Despite the fact that increased tissue expression of Ku proteins was noted in lymphocytic cells with focal sialoadenitis of the minor salivary glands in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome, only 49 cases of a combination of anti-Ku antibodies and manifestations of Sjogren's syndrome have been described in the literature. Some researchers examined patients for the presence of Sjogren's syndrome only if they had anti-Ro or anti-La antibodies, although in the literature, there are descriptions of Sjogren's syndrome in the presence of only isolated anti-Ku antibodies, as in our case. Literature data on glandular and extraglandular manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome in anti-Ku-positive patients are limited. Below, we present the first case of Sjögren's syndrome in combination with the first type of anti-Ku syndrome complicated by the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.

While dose-dense therapy shows promising activity, the optimal management remains to be determined. To evaluate the benefit of consolidative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 47 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed de novo CD5+ DLBCL. Of 19 patients ≤ 70 of age with age-adjusted International Prognostic Index 2-3, eight underwent upfront ASCT, and nine did not, despite preserved organ function and response after induction therapy. The remaining two, ineligible for ASCT due to early progression or comorbidities, had a dismal clinical course. Among younger 17 high-risk patients eligible for ASCT, ASCT was associated with better overall (p = 0.0327) and progression-free survival (p = 0.0184). Younger patients without ASCT demonstrated similar outcomes to older patients with similar risk profiles.

lymphoma,Persistent Cytopenia After CD19 CAR T Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL Patients Could Be a Predictor of Efficacy and Side Effects.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38651796,"Hematological toxicity is a severe adverse event (AE) in anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying prolonged cytopenia and the relationship between persistent cytopenia, efficacy, and AEs after anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy are unknown. Therefore, this study explored whether persistent cytopenia after anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in patients with R/R DLBCL can predict therapeutic efficacy and AEs. Thirty-eight patients with R/R DLBCL were enrolled in an anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy clinical trial. Patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide before CAR T cell therapy. The degree and duration of cytopenia, clinical response, proportion of CAR T cells, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, AEs, and follow-up were observed after therapy. Grades 3-4 persistent cytopenia occurred in 14 patients with R/R DLBCL, who recovered 8-18 weeks after CAR T cell infusion. These patients achieved an objective response rate (ORR) for anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy. In patients who achieved ORR, the incidence of Grades 3-4 persistent cytopenia was higher in patients with a high tumor load than in those without a high tumor load. The mean peaks of IL-6 and anti-CD19 CAR T cells and the cytokine release syndrome grade in patients with Grades 3-4 persistent cytopenia were higher than those in patients without persistent cytopenia. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were observed 21 and 28 days after infusion, and patients had Grades 3-4 persistent cytopenia. Progression-free and overall survival were higher in patients with Grades 3-4 persistent cytopenia than in those without cytopenia. Therefore, persistent cytopenia after anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in patients with R/R DLBCL can predict therapeutic efficacy and AEs, allowing clinicians to determine the efficiency of CD-19 CAR T cell therapy and the associated AEs.","Affiliation

lymphoma,Reclaiming Self-Balancing on a Tightrope Across Time a grounded theory of transition to survivorship in older adult blood cancer survivors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38651679,"Aim:
        
      
      To develop a theoretical understanding of the transition to survivorship in older adult blood cancer survivors.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Qualitative research employing Classic Glaserian Grounded Theory methods.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Purposive and theoretical sampling recruited 17 participants via Leukaemia & Lymphoma Society© Community webpages (65-83 years) from across the US and Canada. Data from individual semi-structured interviews using HIPPA-compliant Zoom© were analysed from September 2020 to March 2021.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants' main concern was losing their sense of self and reclaiming self was the core category. The substantive theory of Reclaiming Self-Balancing on a Tightrope Across Time is a six-phase transition process to survivorship: receiving a blood cancer diagnosis, finding bearings, reclaiming self, persevering through, realizing a transition and living in a new reality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The transition to survivorship in older adult blood cancer survivors is a complex process because of age and disease type.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Age-related aspects of one's sense of self and its relation to health, well-being and quality of life, as older adult blood cancer survivors advance into older age need further research. Ageism and its impact on cancer survivorship care in older adults should also be explored.
    


          Impact:
        
      
      What problem did the study address?: Existing theoretical frameworks do not explain the complex process of transition to survivorship for older adult blood cancer survivors. What were the main findings?: A substantive theory Reclaiming Self-Balancing on a Tightrope Across Time is a six-phase transition process from cancer diagnosis to survivorship characterized by an uncertain and liminal nature. Where and on whom will the research have an impact?: Understanding how older adults experience the transition to survivorship can inform age-appropriate person-centered nursing practices and healthcare policies specific to their needs.

Ocular complications from primary disease include mass effects from ocular adnexal lymphomas and intraocular lymphomas, with B-cell lymphomas accounting for 95% of primary ocular presentations. Secondary disease involvement from systemic hematological malignancies can lead to a wide range of ocular manifestations, such as leukemic retinopathy. Furthermore, toxicity from antineoplastic therapies and ocular graft versus host disease (oGVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation present additional risks to ocular health. In conclusion, ocular complications in blood cancer patients are an integral part of patient management, requiring regular ophthalmic evaluations and close collaboration between oncologists and ophthalmologists.

Surgical reconstruction and limb salvage have become valid options for these patients despite this kind of surgery being challenging due to the need for wide bone resection and the involvement of surrounding soft tissues. Computer-assisted technology helps the surgeon in pre-operative planning and in designing customized implants. The aim of this study was to investigate the surgical outcomes and complications of custom-made prostheses in oncologic reconstruction of the upper limb and if they are reliable options for patients suffering from aggressive tumors. An electronic search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Knowledge was conducted to identify all available articles on the use of custom-made prostheses in oncological resections of the upper limb. Twenty-one studies were included in the review, comprising a total of 145 patients with a mean age of 33.68 years. The bone involved was the humerus in 93 patients, and the radius was involved in 36 patients. There were only six cases involving proximal ulna, three cases involving the scapula, and seven cases involving the elbow as well as soft tissues around it. The most frequent primary tumor was the giant cell tumor, with 36 cases, followed by osteosarcoma with 25 cases, Ewing Sarcoma with 17 cases, and Chondrosarcoma with 7 total cases. Forty patients were affected by bone metastases (such as renal cell cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and rectal cancer) or hematologic diseases involving bone (lymphoma, myeloma, or non-Hodgkin disease). Custom-made prostheses are a viable option for patients who suffer from malignant tumors in their upper limbs.

keytruda,Case report: Salivary duct carcinoma in a patient with a germline CDH1 pathogenic variant - expanding the spectrum of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38651154,"Introduction:
        
      
      Recently, an entity known as salivary duct carcinoma with rhabdoid features (SDC-RF) has been associated with somatic CDH1 mutations. Here we present the first known case report of conventional SDC occurring in the setting of a germline CDH1 pathogenic variant accompanied by a somatic loss of heterozygosity at the CDH1 locus.
    


          Case discussion:
        
      
      A 67-year-old man presented with chest and back pain and was found to have osteolytic lesions in the sternum and lumbar spine. Vertebral bone biopsies were positive for metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary. A molecular profiling assay consisting of both whole-exome next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as immunohistochemistry (IHC) for select clinically-relevant proteins performed on the bone biopsy suggested a triple-negative (ER/PR/ERBB2 negative, by IHC), androgen receptor (AR IHC) positive tumor profile. Additionally, the assay uncovered a coding mutation in the CDH1 gene (c.1792C>T, p.R598*) with genomic loss of the second CDH1 allele. Germline testing returned positive for a heterozygous CDH1 pathogenic variant. PET-CT revealed a tumor in the neck suggestive of the primary malignancy consistent with that of salivary gland origin. The patient was initially treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel, then pembrolizumab, and finally with AR-directed therapy using leuprolide and enzalutamide. These treatments were not successful, and the patient eventually succumbed to his disease.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Molecular testing revealed that our patient had bi-allelic inactivation of the CDH1 gene. We believe our patient developed a somatic mutation in addition to his preexisting germline CDH1 mutation that ultimately predisposed him to SDC. While previous studies have found somatic CDH1 pathogenic variants in SDC-RF, our patient was found to have a germline CDH1 pathogenic variant in the setting of conventional SDC, without rhabdoid features. This case provokes questions regarding tumor genetics and molecular profiling of SDC in patients with germline CDH1 pathogenic variants. Moreover, this case supports the notion that SDC may be the salivary counterpart of other malignancies associated with germline CDH1 pathogenic variants and may possibly expand the spectrum of tumors that arise in this familial cancer-predisposition syndrome.","Affiliations

      The prognosis for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is poor, and there remains an urgent need to develop efficient systemic therapy. The efficacy of Pembrolizumab immunotherapy combined with lenvatinibin in iCCA is still unclear. The role of Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) as a biomarker in iCCA for response to immunotherapy needs further exploration.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      We report a case of a 60-year-old female with EBV-associated advanced iCCA (EBVaiCCA) who progressed after first-line therapy. She accomplished an available response to the combination therapy of pembrolizumab with lenvatinib, with overall survival of 20 months.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      As far as we know, this is the first case report about the application of Pembrolizumab with lenvatinib for EBVaiCCA patients. This case indicates that the combination of immunotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy provides a glimmer of hope for advanced EBVaiCCA patients.","Affiliation

keytruda,Cardiac and Intramuscular Metastases Following Nephroureterectomy for Metachronous Urothelial Carcinoma.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38650318,"BACKGROUND We present a case of metachronous cardiac and intramuscular metastases in a patient with a known history of radical nephroureterectomy for upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). CASE REPORT A 58-year-old man had a history of metachronous renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma with prior left radical nephroureterectomy. He was also diagnosed with malignancy-associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was on rivaroxaban. He presented at an oncology follow-up consult with shortness of breath and right scapular lump. CT scan revealed a soft-tissue mass at the surgical bed suspicious for local recurrence, as well as intracardiac hypodensities and intramuscular nodules in the right latissimus dorsi and right adductor muscles. The intracardiac hypodensities were located in the left atrial appendage and inter-atrial septum. Given that the patient had a history of DVT and in a pro-thrombotic state, differentials for the intracardiac densities included intracardiac thrombi or metastases. The intramuscular hypodensities were rim-enhancing. Given that the patient was on rivaroxaban, differentials included hematomas or metastases. As there was no overlying bruising and the lesions remained unchanged in size clinically, they were treated as metastases. The patient was treated with clexane but re-presented with worsening of shortness of breath and palpitations. CT scan showed increased size of intracardiac lesions, suggesting no response to anticoagulation, and therefore were likely metastatic in nature. He completed a 2-year course of IV pembrolizumab and was in complete remission. CONCLUSIONS Our case highlights the importance of this clinically challenging scenario when patients with known malignancy and on anticoagulation present with cardiac or musculoskeletal symptoms. Though these patients are at risk of thrombus and haematoma, cardiac and intramuscular metastasis should be considered, as the prognosis is guarded.","Affiliation

keytruda,"Merkel Cell Carcinoma: Integrating Epidemiology, Immunology, and Therapeutic Updates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649621,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer characterized by neuroendocrine differentiation. Its carcinogenesis is based either on the integration of the Merkel cell polyomavirus or on ultraviolet (UV) mutagenesis, both of which lead to high immunogenicity either through the expression of viral proteins or neoantigens. Despite this immunogenicity resulting from viral or UV-associated carcinogenesis, it exhibits highly aggressive behavior. However, owing to the rarity of MCC and the lack of epidemiologic registries with detailed clinical data, there is some uncertainty regarding the spontaneous course of the disease. Historically, advanced MCC patients were treated with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy yielding a median response duration of only 3 months. Starting in 2017, four programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors-avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab (utilized in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings), and retifanlimab-have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with disseminated MCC on the basis of prospective clinical trials. However, generating clinical evidence for rare cancers, such as MCC, is challenging owing to difficulties in conducting large-scale trials, resulting in small sample sizes and therefore lacking statistical power. Thus, to comprehensively understand the available clinical evidence on various immunotherapy approaches for MCC, we also delve into the epidemiology and immune biology of this cancer. Nevertheless, while randomized studies directly comparing immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy in MCC are lacking, immunotherapy shows response rates comparable to those previously reported with chemotherapy but with more enduring responses. Notably, adjuvant nivolumab has proven superiority to the standard-of-care therapy (observation) in the adjuvant setting.","Affiliations

His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were 1.48 ng/mL at the time of referral. Initially, a differential diagnosis of prostatitis or seminal vesicle inflammation was made, and four weeks of antibiotics were prescribed, which were later extended to six weeks due to failure of symptoms to resolve. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate was then conducted. The impression was that there was ejaculatory duct obstruction caused by enlarged seminal vesicles with no evidence of significant prostate cancer. The prostate-specific antigen density (PSAd) was 0.04, and the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PIRADS) score was I-II. A CT chest with contrast was conducted for further investigation of pulmonary nodules found on the CT urogram. It revealed multiple calcified pulmonary nodules which were suspicious of malignancy. A CT-guided biopsy of one of the pulmonary nodules was taken, and histopathological analysis revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma. A transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was then performed. Histopathological analysis of the prostatic surgical specimen revealed invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. Based on the findings, a diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate with atypical lung metastasis without osseous or regional lymph node involvement was made, stage T4 N0 M1a. The patient is currently on a treatment regimen consisting of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab.","Affiliations

keytruda,Pembrolizumab in Vaginal Carcinoma: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38645572,"Introduction:
        
      
      Vaginal cancer is a rare gynecologic malignancy. While in a localized disease, concurrent chemoradiation grants local control and better overall survival, in a metastatic setting, the management options are very limited. Furthermore, recurrent cervical, vulvar, and vaginal carcinomas notoriously develop resistance to treatment, and consequently, their prognosis is still poor.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      We herein present the case of a woman with a nodal relapse of vaginal carcinoma, effectively treated with third-line immunotherapy. We will also provide a review of the literature on the new therapeutic strategies for advanced vaginal carcinoma, with a focus on pembrolizumab immunotherapy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pembrolizumab might represent a promising option for the management of vaginal and vulvar cancer, but data to support its use in this setting are still lacking. This case highlights the need for further investigation and trial designs for this rare disease.","Affiliations

keytruda,The emerging therapies are reshaping the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38645513,"Background:
        
      
      Given the superior performance of various therapies over sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the absence of direct comparisons, it is crucial to explore the efficacy of these treatments in phase III randomized clinical trials.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The goal is to identify which patients are most likely to benefit significantly from these emerging therapies, contributing to more personalized and informed clinical decision-making.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Systematic review and network meta-analysis.
    


          Data sources and methods:
        
      
      PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and international conference databases have been searched from 1 January 2010 to 1 December 2023.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After screening, 17 phase III trials encompassing 18 treatments were included. In the whole-population network meta-analysis, the newly first-line tremelimumab plus durvalumab (Tre + Du) was found to be comparable with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo + Beva) in providing the best overall survival (OS) benefit [hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.92]. Concerning OS benefits, sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar (Sint + Beva), camrelizumab plus rivoceranib (Camre + Rivo), and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Lenva + Pemb) appear to exhibit similar effects to Tre + Du and Atezo + Beva. In the context of progression-free survival, Atezo + Beva seemed to outperform Tre + Du (HR: 0.66 CI: 0.49-0.87), while the effects are comparable to Sint + Beva, Camre + Rivo, and Lenva + Pemb. Upon comparison between Asia-Pacific and non-Asia-Pacific cohorts, as well as between hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected and non-HBV-infected populations, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based treatments seemed to exhibit heightened efficacy in the Asia-Pacific group and among individuals with HBV infection. However, combined ICI-based therapies did not show more effectiveness than molecular-targeted drugs in patients without macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread. As for grades 3-5 adverse events, combined therapies showed comparable safety to sorafenib and lenvatinib.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Compared with sorafenib and lenvatinib, combination therapies based on ICIs significantly improved the prognosis of advanced HCC and demonstrated similar safety. At the same time, the optimal treatment approach should be tailored to individual patient characteristics, such as etiology, tumor staging, and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. With lower incidence rates of treatment-related adverse events and non-inferior efficacy compared to sorafenib, ICI monotherapies should be prioritized as a first-line treatment approach for patients who are not suitable candidates for ICI-combined therapies.

keytruda,[Current Status and Issues of Companion Diagnostics in Cancer Genomic Medicine].,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38644302,"As of December 2023, there are 5 types of cancer gene panel tests covered by public insurance in Japan. Four of them partly feature companion diagnostics. When cancer gene panel test is used for the purpose of comprehensive gene profiling (CGP), a total of 56,000 points(44,000 points for the test administration fee and 12,000 points for the expert panel fee) can be claimed, whereas if the cancer gene panel test is used for the purpose of companion diagnostics, hospitals can claim only the reimbursement as a companion diagnostics, which fee is much cheaper than that of CGP. Therefore, cancer gene panel tests are rarely used as a companion diagnosis in daily clinical practice. Even when the test is performed as a CGP test, since its indication is limited to patients who have completed or are expected to complete standard chemotherapy, most biomarkers associated with approved drugs are already evaluated with stand-alone companion diagnostics at the time of CGP test application. On the other hand, there are some approved drugs, such as pembrolizumab for TMB-H or entrectinib or larotrectinib for NTRK fusion gene, for which there is no stand-alone companion diagnostics and the eligibility for these drugs cannot be judged without the results of CGP test. This paper discusses the current status and issues of companion diagnostics in cancer genomic medicine.","Affiliation

Methods: This study used a retrospective cohort study method based on real-world data. Clinical data of 403 patients with stage III gastric/esophagogastric junction cancer who underwent gastrectomy followed by adjuvant therapy in the Department of Gastric Surgery at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from January 2020 to December 2023 were retrospectively collected. The study cohort comprised 147 (36.5%) patients with stage IIIA, 130 (32.3%) with stage IIIB, and 126 (31.3%) with stage IIIC gastric/esophagogastric junction cancer. Of them, 15 (3.7%) were HER-2 positive, 25 (6.2%) dMMR, and 22 (5.5%) patients Epstein-Barr virus encoding RNA (EBER) positive. Based on treatment plans, the patients were divided into immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy group (immune therapy group, n=110, 71 males and 39 females, median age 59 years old) and chemotherapy alone group (chemotherapy group, n=293, 186 males and 107 females, median age 60 years old). All patients in the immunotherapy group received immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1). Of them, 85 received pembrolizumab, 10 received sintilimab, 8 received tislelizumab, 4 received camrelizumab, 2 received toripalimab, and 1 received pabocizumab. The adjuvant chemotherapy regimens used among the chemotherapy alone group includes SOX regimen (132 cases), XELOX (102 cases), S-1 monotherapy (44 cases), and other regimens (15 cases). The 3-year DFS rate of the two groups was compared, and subgroup analysis was conducted based on different ages, molecular phenotypes, pTNM staging, extranodal infiltration, and tumor length. Results: The median follow-up was 20.5 months (range 3.1~46.3), with a 3-year overall DFS rate of 61.4% for the entire 403 patients. The 3-year DFS rate for the immunotherapy group was 82.7%, higher than the chemotherapy alone group (58.8%), with a statistically significant difference (P=0.021). Multivariate analysis showed that postoperative immunotherapy was a protective factor for DFS (HR=0.352, 95%CI: 0.180~0.685). Subgroup analysis showed that stage IIIC (HR=0.416, 95%CI: 0.184~0.940), aged ≥60 years (HR=0.336, 95%CI: 0.121~0.934) and extranodal invasion (HR=0.378, 95%CI: 0.170~0.839) were associated with benefit from the combined immune adjuvant chemotherapy, while no association was observed for MMR, HER-2 or EBER status. Conclusion: Stage III gastric/esophagogastric junction cancer patients may benefite from postoperative immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with adjuvant chemotherapy in real-world settings.","Affiliation
