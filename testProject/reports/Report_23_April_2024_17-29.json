    "summary": "The collected data provides insights into recent advancements and economic evaluations in leukemia treatments, focusing on new therapeutic agents and strategies. Notable findings include the development of spirooxadiazoline-oxindoles derived from imatinib showing promising antimyeloproliferative potential in K562 cells. Additionally, the economic analysis reveals that venetoclax-based regimens offer cost savings compared to BTK inhibitors in second-line treatments. Furthermore, the study on MNDA expression highlights its diagnostic value in differentiating various B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These insights collectively suggest significant progress in personalized and cost-effective treatment approaches for leukemia."
