leukemia,"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Version 2.2024.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38626800,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are essentially different manifestations of the same disease that are similarly managed. A number of molecular and cytogenetic variables with prognostic implications have been identified. Undetectable minimal residual disease at the end of treatment with chemoimmunotherapy or venetoclax-based combination regimens is an independent predictor of improved survival among patients with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL. The selection of treatment is based on the disease stage, presence or absence of del(17p) or TP53 mutation, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status, patient age, performance status, comorbid conditions, and the agent's toxicity profile. This manuscript discusses the recommendations outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with CLL/SLL.","William G Wierda

leukemia,Clinical Risks for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38626793,"Our understanding of risk factors for the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is still incomplete and includes genetic and environmental factors. CLL is one of the most familial of all cancers, yet common high-penetrance risk alleles have not been identified. Genome-wide association studies have identified many common variants with low relative risks, whereas exome-wide rare variant analysis has implicated ATM in CLL causation. Environmental factors have also been challenging to identify given the limited understanding of the relevant time period of exposure relative to diagnosis, and the inability to quantify past exposures. Agent Orange and glyphosate herbicides have perhaps the most data to support their role. CLL is preceded by a precursor condition called monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), which could therefore be considered a risk factor, but which itself is likely caused by the same risk factors that ultimately give rise to CLL. Although virtually all people with CLL have a preceding MBL phase, most people with MBL will not develop CLL.","Jennifer R Brown

leukemia,Prognostic Implications of Circulating Plasma Cell Percentage in Multiple Myeloma and Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia Defined by New Criteria.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38626745,"Introduction:
        
      
      The definition of primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) has been revised from ≥20% to ≥5% circulating plasma cells (CPC). However, the precise prognosis associated with CPC remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate prognostic biomarkers for myeloma patients based on CPC presence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 309 consecutive patients diagnosed with either multiple myeloma or pPCL, utilizing peripheral blood smears stained with Wright-Giemsa.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients were grouped by CPC percentage: 0% (221, 71.5%), 1-4% (49, 15.9%), 5-19% (16, 5.2%), ≥20% (23, 7.4%). CPC >5% correlated with unfavorable characteristics, including anemia, renal dysfunction, and advanced International Staging System. Common cytogenetic abnormalities such as 1q21 amplification, 17p deletion, and Myc rearrangement were prevalent among CPC-positive patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were shorter in patients with CPC ≥5% (29.47 vs. 10.03 months; 64.10 vs. 12.30 months). Additionally, PFS and OS were shorter in CPC-positive patients without autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and those with response < partial remission to the first-line regimen. Furthermore, an association emerged between soft tissue-related extramedullary disease and inferior PFS, while Myc rearrangement correlated with abbreviated OS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Biological characteristics displayed greater aggressiveness in patients with positive CPC, leading to significantly shorter PFS and OS. The presence of CPC, ASCT, and overall response rate were independent prognostic factors. While no new threshold for pPCL with CPCs is proposed, but Myc rearrangements and CPC positivity could serve as ultra-high-risk factors for multiple myeloma.","Xianghong Jin, Xianyong Jiang, Hui Li, Kaini Shen, Shuangjiao Liu, Miao Chen, Chen Yang, Bing Han, Junling Zhuang; Xianghong Jin, Xianyong Jiang, Hui Li, Kaini Shen, Shuangjiao Liu, Miao Chen, Chen Yang, Bing Han, Junling Zhuang",,,2024 Apr 16.

leukemia,MNDA expression and its value in differential diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas: a comprehensive analysis of a large series of 1293 cases.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38627702,"Aims:
        
      
      MNDA (myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen) has been considered as a potential diagnostic marker for marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), but its utility in distinguishing MZL from other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHLs) and its clinicopathologic relevance in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are ambiguous. We comprehensively investigated MNDA expression in a large series of B-NHLs and evaluated its diagnostic value.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MNDA expression in a cohort of 1293 cases of B-NHLs and 338 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) was determined using immunohistochemistry and compared among different types of B-NHL. The clinicopathologic relevance of MNDA in DLBCL was investigated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      MNDA was highly expressed in MZLs (437/663, 65.9%), compared with the confined staining in marginal zone B-cells in RLH; whereas neoplastic cells with plasmacytic differentiation lost MNDA expression. MNDA expression was significantly higher in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, 79.6%, p = 0.006), whereas lower in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL, 44.8%, p = 0.001) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL, 25%, p = 0.016), and dramatically lower in follicular lymphoma (FL, 5.2%, p < 0.001), compared with MZL. 29.6% (63/213) of DLBCLs were positive for MNDA. The cases in non-GCB group exhibited a higher rate of MNDA positivity (39.8%) compared to those in GCB group (16.3%) (p < 0.001), and MNDA staining was more frequently observed in DLBCLs with BCL2/MYC double-expression (50%) than those without BCL2/MYC double-expression (24.8%) (p = 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between MNDA and CD5 expression in DLBCL (p = 0.036).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      MNDA was highly expressed in MZL with a potential utility in differential diagnosis between MZL and RLH as well as FL, whereas its value in distinguishing MZL from MCL, CLL/SLL is limited. In addition, MNDA expression in DLBCL was more frequently seen in the non-GCB group and the BCL2/MYC double-expression group, and demonstrated a correlation with CD5, which deserves further investigation. The clinical relevance of MNDA and its correlation with the prognosis of these lymphomas also warrant to be fully elucidated.","Li-Fen Zhang

leukemia,A novel immunogenic cell death-related classification indicates the immune landscape and predicts clinical outcome and treatment response in acute myeloid leukemia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38627685,"Background:
        
      
      Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is closely related to anti-tumor therapy and regulates the tumor microenvironment (TME). This study aims to explore the molecular characteristics of ICD in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to analyze the value of ICD-related biomarkers in TME indication, prognosis prediction, and treatment response evaluation in AML.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to calculate the ICD score. LASSO regression was used to construct a prognostic risk score model. We also analyzed differences in clinical characteristics, immune landscape, immunotherapy response, and chemotherapy sensitivity between high-risk and low-risk patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study identified two ICD-related subtypes and found significant heterogeneity in clinical prognosis, TME, and immune landscape between different ICD subtypes. Subsequently, a novel ICD-related prognostic risk score model was developed, which accurately predicted the prognosis of AML patients and was validated in nine AML cohorts. Moreover, there were significant correlations between risk scores and clinicopathological factors, somatic mutations, TME characteristics, immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy response, and chemosensitivity. We further validated the model gene expression in a clinically real-world cohort.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The novel ICD-related signatures identified and validated by us can serve as promising biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes, chemotherapy sensitivity, and immunotherapy response in AML patients, guiding the establishment of personalized and accurate treatment strategies for AML.","Fangmin Zhong

leukemia,Autophagy degrades immunogenic endogenous retroelements induced by 5-azacytidine in acute myeloid leukemia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38627586,"The hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine (AZA) is the first-line treatment for AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. The effect of AZA results in part from T-cell cytotoxic responses against MHC-I-associated peptides (MAPs) deriving from hypermethylated genomic regions such as cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), or endogenous retroelements (EREs). However, evidence supporting higher ERE MAPs presentation after AZA treatment is lacking. Therefore, using proteogenomics, we examined the impact of AZA on the repertoire of MAPs and their source transcripts. AZA-treated AML upregulated both CTA and ERE transcripts, but only CTA MAPs were presented at greater levels. Upregulated ERE transcripts triggered innate immune responses against double-stranded RNAs but were degraded by autophagy, and not processed into MAPs. Autophagy resulted from the formation of protein aggregates caused by AZA-dependent inhibition of DNMT2. Autophagy inhibition had an additive effect with AZA on AML cell proliferation and survival, increased ERE levels, increased pro-inflammatory responses, and generated immunogenic tumor-specific ERE-derived MAPs. Finally, autophagy was associated with a lower abundance of CD8+ T-cell markers in AML patients expressing high levels of EREs. This work demonstrates that AZA-induced EREs are degraded by autophagy and shows that inhibiting autophagy can improve the immune recognition of AML blasts in treated patients.","Nandita Noronha

leukemia,Spirooxadiazoline-oxindoles derived from imatinib show antimyeloproliferative potential in K562 cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38627294,"Imatinib mesylate was the first representative BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) class for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Despite the revolution promoted by TKIs in the treatment of this pathology, a resistance mechanism occurs against all BCR-ABL1 inhibitors, necessitating a constant search for new therapeutic options. To develop new antimyeloproliferative substances, we applied a medicinal chemistry tool known as molecular hybridization to design 25 new substances. These compounds were synthesized and biologically evaluated against K562 cells, which express BCR-ABL1, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase enzyme, as well as in WSS-1 cells (healthy cells). The new compounds are conjugated hybrids that contain phenylamino-pyrimidine-pyridine (PAPP) and an isatin backbone, which are the main pharmacophoric fragments of imatinib and sunitinib, respectively. A spiro-oxindole nucleus was used as a linker because it occurs in many compounds with antimyeloproliferative activity. Compounds 2a, 2b, 3c, 4c, and 4e showed promise, as they inhibited cell viability by between 45% and 61% at a concentration of 10 µM. The CC50 of the most active substances was determined to be within 0.8-9.8 µM.","Liviane D de Azevedo

leukemia,Real-World Health Care Resource Use and Costs Among Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treated With Venetoclax-Based and Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Based Regimens in the Second-Line Setting.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38626366,"Purpose:
        
      
      Real-world evidence comparing health care resource use (HRU) and costs between novel targeted therapies among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is lacking. We compared all-cause and CLL-specific HRU and costs between patients initiated on B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor (venetoclax)- or Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi)-based regimens in the second-line (2L) setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a retrospective observational study using Optum Clinformatics Data Mart of adult patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma who received 2L venetoclax- or BTKi-based regimens (January 2018-December 2021) for the first time and had ≥one CLL diagnostic claim after 2L initiation and ≥two claims for venetoclax or BTKi. Baseline characteristics were balanced using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights. Mean monthly cost difference (MMCD) between cohorts for all-cause and CLL-specific per patient per month (PPPM) costs was estimated. Rates of PPPM-HRU were compared between cohorts using rate ratios (RRs).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 280 patients, median age 75.5 years, 64.6% and 35.4% received BTKi- versus venetoclax-based regimens, respectively. Most BTKi-treated patients received monotherapy (88.4%), whereas 62.3% of venetoclax-treated patients received combination therapy with anti-CD20 agents. The median duration of 2L therapy was 11.6 and 11.0 months for BTKi versus venetoclax cohorts, respectively. All-cause total costs were lower for venetoclax versus BTKi (MMCD [SE], $-2,497.64 [$1,006.77] in US dollars (USD); P = .01), driven by lower medication costs offsetting medical costs; trends were similar for CLL-specific estimates. Outpatient HRU was higher for venetoclax versus BTKi (RR all-cause: 1.22 v CLL-specific: 1.64).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Venetoclax was associated with total monthly cost savings versus BTKis, illustrating the economic value of time-limited venetoclax-based regimens in the 2L setting.","Bita Fakhri

leukemia,Real-world status of treatment for lymphoid neoplasms developed during the course of myeloproliferative neoplasms in Japan.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38626148,"Objectives:
        
      
      Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are at higher risk of developing secondary malignancies. In this study, we focused on patients with MPNs that complicated lymphoid neoplasms. To analyze the real-world status of lymphoid neoplasm treatment in patients with pre-existing MPNs in Japan, we conducted a multicenter retrospective study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Questionnaires were sent to collect the data on patients who were first diagnosed with either polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia or myelofibrosis and who later were complicated with lymphoid neoplasms defined as malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphoma.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-four patients with MPNs complicated by lymphoid neoplasms were enrolled (polycythemia vera, n = 8; essential thrombocythemia, n = 14; and primary myelofibrosis, n = 2). Among these, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was the most frequently observed (n = 13, 54.1%). Twelve (92.3%) of the patients with DLBCL received conventional chemotherapy. Among these 12 patients, regarding cytoreductive therapy for MPNs, 8 patients stopped treatment, one continued treatment, and two received a reduced dose. Consequently, most patients were able to receive conventional chemotherapy for DLBCL with a slightly higher dose of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support than usual without worse outcomes. All 3 patients with multiple myeloma received a standard dose of chemotherapy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our data indicate that if aggressive lymphoid neoplasms develop during the course of treatment in patients with MPNs, it is acceptable to prioritize chemotherapy for lymphoma.","Yoko Edahiro
