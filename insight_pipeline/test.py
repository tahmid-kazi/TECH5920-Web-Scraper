Baseline characteristics were balanced using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights. Mean monthly cost difference (MMCD) between cohorts for all-cause and CLL-specific per patient per month (PPPM) costs was estimated. Rates of PPPM-HRU were compared between cohorts using rate ratios (RRs).\n    \n          Results:\n\nTitle: Refining the impact of genetic evidence on clinical success\nAuthor: Eric Vallabh Minikel, Jeffery L.
