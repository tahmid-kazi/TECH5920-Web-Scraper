# TECH5920-Web-Scraper
Web Scraper as the deliverable for BigCo Studio at Cornell Tech (Spring 2024)

## Scraping pipeline operation
All scraping modules are operated using the 'parent_scraper.py' file located in /demoProject/scraping_pipeline. To run the scrapers, a scraper description file needs to be added and passed to the module as input (see example 'scraperDescription.txt' in /demoProject/projectprofile). The format needs to be followed exactly for the pipeline to work. It's a bit janky for now, but we can work on that and then just edit the parent_scraper.py file.
