# TECH5920-Web-Scraper
Web Scraper as the deliverable for BigCo Studio at Cornell Tech (Spring 2024)

# **Scraping Pipeline Operation**

The scraping pipeline in this project is operated using the `parent_scraper.py` file located in `/demoProject/scraping_pipeline`. To run the scrapers, a scraper description file needs to be added and passed to the module as input (see example `scraperDescription.txt` in `/demoProject/projectprofile`). The format has to be maintained for it to work.
It is a bit *janky*, but we can change it later on, and we would only need to edit the `parent_scraper.py`.

## **Usage**

1. Navigate to the `scraping_pipeline` directory.
2. Add the scraper description file (e.g., `scraperDescription.txt`) to the `projectprofile` directory.
3. Run the scraping pipeline by executing the `parent_scraper.py` file while passing the scraping description file as an input.
